“Kate” knew the answer. All the world’s problems would be solved if everyone in the world “just got their land back.” She would have been right about 5,000 years ago. But since then, the human project has become something so much more complex and wonderful than a farm. People want more than a farm. Even committed farmers want so much more than a farm — they want all the things, ideas, music and art that are not made on farms. And they want, someday, to go to a Broadway Play, or Disney World. 

I, for one, love the Kindle, despite all its usability flaws and destructive influence in the publishing world. I am kind of dyslexic, which makes me an incredibly slow reader. It has been the bane of my existence, because I love to read and love to learn. The Kindle has changed everything for me. It machine-reads books at 4X speed while I scan the words with my eyes. It lets me get through a big book in a fraction of the time it used to take me. I want to keep my Kindle. And I want more innovations like it. I want eventually to have all the knowledge locked away in all these millions of books available for download right in to my brain. I rally want that. And that is not coming from any farm.

But yes, for people who live in farming economies, who are turning over most or all of what they produce to other people, getting ones land back is truly the most important thing. And that is still a couple of billion people.

Kate was sending half her tips to an organization in Honduras that bought land back for the landless foot by square foot. She was going to be a rock star a few years later, but she didn’t know that at the time. When I met her, she was dreaming of the liberation of all humanity while working as a bartender in Columbus, Ohio.

I told her that billions of people had actually already won back control of their land over the past couple hundred years — with guns. She didn’t like the sound of it. Sending tips to Honduras was safe, unambiguous and easy. The historical process I described was difficult, messy and terrifying. She suggested we never talk about land or poverty again.

Here’s the messy story of how billions of people got back to the land:

It all started in America, where land was “free” for millions of Europeans who came to gain access to an independent living — something known only to a few back in Europe. Free as in: free to occupy if you could defend it from its original inhabitants. “Guns, Germs and Steel” made that a pretty sure bet over the long run. Free also as in Freedom — freedom meaning enough land, or property, to make a living without having to work for anyone else. Today “freedom” means a lot of things. But back then, it meant above all the condition of owning enough “property” (meaning land) to be able to earn ones own living without being unevenly dependent on others.

Landless Europeans wanted land so badly, they were willing to sell themselves into slavery — usually for a contract of seven or so years. They knew they would probably die in the harsh conditions of the New World before their time was up. They were gambling their lives for the small plot of land they hoped to claim after earning their freedom. That’s how America restored, to people who had lost it, an earlier stage of humanity: an agrarian people in which families and communities controlled their own land. The American people loved that dream enough to fight a revolution to defend it when the British announced their intentions to undermine it. 

Word spread about what poor people had regained in America. Partly inspired by the success of the American Revolution, peasants and workers rose up in France in a way history had never witnessed before. It was the French Revolution! — the first industrial strength revolution. The world was used to peasant uprisings, even ones that attracted the support of some of the middle and upper classes. But in the end, maybe with a few concessions, the landowners had always won back control.  This time, with the seizure of the whole state apparatus, the rebellion became a revolution, reshaping society, and reshaping forever the relationship of the people and the land. Peasants drove out landowners and burnt all the deeds. To this day, when flying into any large French city, you will see all the land around it divided up neatly into family farms, liberated way back in the revolution, centered around tiny confident village communities. 

After the French Revolution, Napoleon wound up in charge (long story). He used the power of the new modern revolutionary army to conquer most of Europe. He was no revolutionary liberator, but he was a modernizer who wanted to create a new modern empire to go with his new modern army. Wherever he went, he established modern law and administration. He also redistributed land and wiped out some of the old aristocracy. It was just the natural thing to do: they were an obstacle to his domination and now there was an alternate way to organize the land, requiring no aristocracy. 

Once again, word spread. Peasants and serfs all over Europe wanted in on the action. In some places they rose up. But in others, princes and kings were smart enough to avoid revolution by organizing land reform proactively. In Prussia, the precursor to modern Germany, the king bought out his aristocrats — a move that paved the way for the rise of the powerful Prussian capitalist economy. 

Same thing happened in a lot of little pockets all over Europe. A while later, same thing happened in Russia under Tsar Alexander II — sort of.

The real thing came in 1917 when Lenin cemented his control over the Russian Revolution by making a promise to the starving, war-weary Russian people: “Land, Bread, Peace.” You’ll notice that land came first. 

But the Russian revolution seemed not only to give land to the people, but also to deliver the whole package of modernity. The Russian people were engaged in building up their very own shiny, modern, industrial economy. They accomplished faster rates of growth — in production and living standards — than had ever been witnessed on earth, terrifying the leadership of the capitalist world. Whatever was really going on, however terrible, however it would end up in the end — whatever you think of it — the fact at the time was that the peasants and workers of the whole world saw it as victory and wanted in. 

And so struggles began across Asia, Africa, Mexico, South and Central America, holding up the Red Flag, sending leaders to train in the USSR, and often scoring a victory here or there. 

The big one came in China, 1949. The Chinese Communist Party redistributed land to almost a fifth of the humanity. Their practice of redistributing land to the people was the Communists’ most powerful military tactic. Everywhere they went, the hungry, oppressed peasants did whatever they could to sabotage the Japanese occupation or corrupt “Nationalist” Chinese government. Landlords who had abused generations of peasants were hauled in front of their tenants to receive ritualistic, cathartic abuse. Around a few percent of them were killed. 

Peasants and workers everywhere were now perfectly clear: The world working class was on a winning streak. They wanted what the Chinese had just gotten. Peasants and workers everywhere learned of the events in China. It totally transformed their expectations for the rest of the 20th century. In his auto-biography, Nelson Mandela writes of being shaped by Edgar Snow’s Red Star Over China, a riveting account of the makings of the revolution, in prison. For another billion or two human beings, the way forward was clear. 

At about the same time, the United States had just begun its military occupation of South Korea and Japan. A few wise young people in the occupation administrations understood what was going on and convinced the U.S. to carry out the exact same kind of land redistribution in South Korea and Japan as the communists had in China. Along with that, Marines roamed the countryside slitting the throats of the few socialists not already killed by the Japanese army during its occupation of Korea. The people got their land. That’s all they had really wanted, so the cause of communism was effectively dead. 

At the same time, the old Chinese “Nationalist” government was beginning its takeover of Taiwan, after fleeing mainland China. In a new land, and with the example of the Communists behind them, they redistributed the land of Taiwanese landlords.

But that’s where the line was drawn.

In Greece, where communists were taking over, their former anti-Nazi resistance partners in the CIA (called the OSS back then) were ordered to wipe them out. You can read the heartbreaking letters by some of them, forced to kill some of the bravest people they would ever meet in their lives.

During Indian independence, a revolutionary movement got rolling bent on redistributing India’s land to another fifth of humanity. Mahatma Gandhi’s Congress movement brutally repressed the movement, rounding up and imprisoned 50,000 leaders and activists.  

In Vietnam, the Vietcong were beginning to formulate a program for land redistribution. The U.S. of course got invoked to try to stop that. We showed that a massive price would be paid by any people who tried to get their land back.   

All over Asia, South America and Africa, leaders who suggested land reform were assassinated, their governments over thrown. 

In those places, the old feudal aristocracies, opposed to modernization and industrialization, remained in power and held things back. In 1945, for example, the Philippines was more highly developed industrially than South Korea. But its aristocratic land owning class was left in charge. They lived by exploiting peasants and allowing foreign countries to extract resources. They were not interested in national development — at least not all that interested. Therefore, South Korea powered ahead, quickly becoming a “First World” nation, while the Philippines languishes even today in abject poverty. 

What does all this mean for us? 

That is a big question. It will take some sorting through. We’ve got time. 

But basically, the questions are: In America, where making a living no longer has anything to do with land for 98% of the people, what is the resource that matters? And is there an extractive class, equivalent to the Philippines’ old extractive parasite landowners, who are presiding over the decline of American fortunes? And if there is a class like that, then what must we learn from the movement that got a couple billion people their land back?

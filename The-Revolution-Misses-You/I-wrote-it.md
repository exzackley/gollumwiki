My blackberry buzzed. I glanced at the email from one of the campaign’s many communications directors. Maybe the one in charge. No one really knew who was in charge. 

He asked, “Did you really write this?” Then he quoted a long Internet rant that ended with, “Terry McAuliffe is an idiot.” A political reporter had dredged up something from my very recent past. 

The problem was Terry McAuliffe was the Chairman of the Democratic Party. And was sitting across the table from me. 

John Kerry's 2004 campaign had just hired me a few weeks earlier to be “director of online fundraising and organizing." I was an unlikely candidate for the job, considering that I was an anti-capitalist, union organizer radical who believed the Democratic party was an evil organization devoted to the disempowerment of the American people. 

But they offered me the job, and what was I going to say? It’s not like I had anything else to do. It was so unlikely that these people would be talking to me at all, let alone talking about this job. Saying no would have been an unforgivable insult to the fates. Now I was just waiting to see where this was all going to lead. 

Today, millions of Americans believe the Democratic party is a socialist organization. I can assure them, it is not. The whole Kerry staff were essentially Eisenhower Republicans, as Bill Clinton had labeled the Democratic Party — albeit atheist  Eisenhower Republicans, who liked gay people, and abortions. They believed fundamentally in the sanctity of free market capitalism, perfected with wise (and as little as possible) regulation, and padded with a very thin social safety net. Most of them had tentatively supported the war with Iraq with the rationale: “We can’t just let a mad man like this amass weapons of mass destruction!” Many of the big wigs on staff would set up consultancies with Republicans after the campaign. Some of them already had. 

In the time I spent on the Kerry campaign, I never heard anyone speak out of concern for poor and working Americans who had seen their earning power crumble over the past half century, for the bottom half of American families who live in debt on less than $20,000 a year; or the generation of young people robbed of an education; or the million Americans incarcerated with long sentences for nonviolent drug infractions; or even the hundred million working class women who’d lost access to reproductive health services (as long as wealthy women had access to abortions, that seemed good enough for these Democrats). No one cared about any of that stuff. 

I’ll never forget when, at a party, one staffer matter-of-factly explained to me that AIDS was nature’s way of controlling Africa’s “population problem.” 

Those staffers were not like so many of the good grassroots Dems you may know, or like so many of the sincere and idealistic young Obama organizers who represented the party for a brief moment in 2008. The motivation of most of these 2004 staffers was simple and clear: if they won, they would go to the White House, or set up big consulting firms. If they lost, they would probably disappear into oblivion. 

By Election Day, I was praying for a loss. I couldn’t imagine what would happen to the country if these people who stood for nothing but themselves got control of the country. I was still hoping, I guess, that some kind of idealism and integrity, however misguided, might someday resurge. If these Kerry people won, it would never happen. 

I was living and working among the enemy. But where else was there to go? I had tried being an Obi Wan Kenobi hermit. You know: my ancient religion, the Old Left, was dead — the Empire had completely wiped it out, save for a few confused droids who were still wandering around hocking the Socialist Worker at environmental rallies.

Instead of retreating to a cave on a lost desert planet, I went to Vancouver, Canada. It was so damn nice there. I tried to forget about the world. I ran around Stanley Park every morning, star fish and dolphins all the way. I lounged in cozy coffee shops and ate great Korean food every night. I made a living programming computers, which I loved because it was so honest, so unambiguous, so pure — totally the opposite of politics. 

I knew it couldn't last. I had tried dropping out before. Eventually, I started getting into fights after a few drinks at parties with random yuppies. When I was living a nice comfortable life, disengaged from any kind of revolutionary path, I just went crazy. Without a mission, I would eventually crumble into a drunken ranting street walker with no job and no friends. I had come to terms with that years earlier, but here I was again, trying one more time to be a civilian.  

The straw that broke the camel’s back this time was Bush talking about a war with Iraq. What the hell! And the Democrats were not even asking the basic, obvious questions. Like: “WHAT IN GOD’S NAME DOES IRAQ HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?!”

By this time, I had developed a little side career as an Internet prankster and organizer. This was way back in 2002. I thought maybe this Internet thing could somehow be used to balance the scales in the contest between Bush, with all his corporate megabucks, and whatever Bush twin the Dems would nominate. I didn’t care about the Democrats, but I believed it was important to teach these people that if you start a war to cement your power, that the American people will throw you out. That’s what happened to Bush #1 — only no one got the moral of the story. If the same thing happened to Bush #2, the lesson would be unmistakable.

I kept sending the people at MoveOn.org — there were just a few of them at the time — memos about how I believed we could raise $100 million online for an anti-war nominee. I also called up the campaign of this guy Howard Dean, who was running for president and seemed to be the only Democrat boldly opposing the non sequitur of war with Iraq. The high school student who answered the phone said he’d pass the message on. 

I realized I was now officially one of those loner cranks, living under a rock someplace, with BIG IDEAS THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR. I had gotten emails from people like me before — now I was sending them. I had a lost decade in the labor movement behind me. I had a couple hundred dollars in my bank account. I had a failing laptop. I had a mental virus that was forcing me to leave paradise.

One night I had one of those incredibly vivid dreams that I seem to get every decade or so -- dreams that feel more real than reality. I was in a lunar module from 1969, orbiting around the dark side of the moon, very fast, in a very low orbit, with the huge craters and mountains of the moon illuminated only by starlight silently rolling past overhead. In the dream, I had somehow been coming around the dark side of the moon for years. Now finally I saw a crack of sunlight over the grey horizon. I saw the the Earth. I was back in radio contact.

The next morning, I got a call from Wes Boyd at MoveOn asking me to come to their next staff retreat, maybe to take a job with them. He was looking for an organizer who was also a computer programmer. Luckily, I was the only one he'd ever heard of.

One thing led to another and now here I was, scarcely two years later, signing emails as John Kerry to millions of people. And it looked like I actually was going to raise $100 million for, if not the anti-war candidate, as least the one running against the war candidate.

“Yes, I wrote it,” I replied to the communications director, and carried on my meeting with McAuliffe.

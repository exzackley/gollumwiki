I got my politics when my high school girlfriend ran off with a rich kid. 

What made it so surprising was that I had kind of assumed I was a rich kid. We lived in a wealthy suburb. I seemed to be as well or better off than most of the kids in my public school. Unbeknownst to me, there was another whole universe of truly rich kids who lived just a few blocks west and were invisible because they attended elite boarding schools around New England. 

My girlfriend was a poor kid — ranked first in our class. She lived literally on the wrong side of the tracks, in the tiny low-income corner of our town that bordered Hartford, Connecticut. One semester, she went off, on scholarship, to one of the super elite boarding schools in New England. Quickly she got a new boyfriend — one that, she reported with astonishment, had houses in many beautiful places around New England, and a BMW with which to visit them on weekends, with her. 

And so it was that I, with vanes flooding with the adrenaline of jealous rage, looked up from somewhere in the middle of the top one percentile of global wealth, and noticed for the first time those above me.

How pathetic. 

And yet, some version of that story belongs to pretty much every serious revolutionary and social movement leader ever. 

Lenin was the child of a small city bureaucrat and a school teacher. He was super smart, and really annoyed that he hadn’t had the same opportunities as rich kids in his school who were far less able than himself. After his brother, an anarchist, got wrapped up in a conspiracy to kill the Tsar, Lenin was cut off from any chance at a successful career inside the system. His anger at the ultra rich combined with his restricted circumstances to lead him down the only path to greatness that was available to him: revolution. 

Mao was the son of a middling peasant who could just barely afford to send him to a local boarding school. Mao was one of the smartest students, but also the one with the shabbiest clothes. The rich kids teased him. If only they knew the situation they were setting up for themselves!

Fidel was the son of a successful — though not huge — sugar planter. His mother was a domestic servant who became his father’s second wife. He was permanently excluded from Cuban high society, but had all the qualities of a national leader.  

Ho Chi Minh, also from an upper middle class background, admired the United States so much that he hitched a ride on a steamer to San Francisco. He worked his way across the country, winding up as a dishwasher in Boston at the Parker House Hotel. He retained a love for United States institutions — even copying Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence when it came time for him many years later to write Vietnam’s. 

Speaking of Jefferson. You guessed it: he came from an upper middle class background but his uneducated father was not super rich. As he entered Virginian society, at the college of William and Mary shortly after his father died, Jefferson was distinguished not by his wealth, but by his phenomenal intellect. He, like all the Founders, had a huge inferiority complex toward the British aristocracy, from which he was permanently excluded, no matter how much wealth he might acquire, and an acute awareness that he was only a medium sized fish in a tiny pond in a backwater far away from the action of the world. 

Ben Franklin had the same chip on his shoulder times 100, because unlike Jefferson he did not even own land (which was the mark of independence in those times). He knew he was smarter than anyone in the British government or aristocracy — which is why it infuriated him so that they would never accept him into their ranks. It was only after a public humiliation in front of crowd at court that he finally gave up his climber pretensions and put on the coon skin hat. 

John Adams, a small but successful farmer, was awed by his first visit to Britain, and made ashamed of the small, rural, backward nation he represented. Part of what fueled the Founders’ resolve to become independent was the tension of their inferiority in wealth and power to their English counterparts against their superiority in education and Enlightenment values. 

George Washington had a double inferiority complex: he began life with neither great wealth nor a great education. He showed them all, dying America’s first millionaire and possibly the most respected man in the world — just after declining an invitation to be an honored guest of the revolutionary people of France because, unlike almost every other major American leader, he did not speak French. 

Gandhi came from the same well-off-but-not-super-rich origins as everyone else I just mentioned, and had to endure endless humiliations as a law student in Britain. 

Martin Luther King grew up in a well-off family, always the smartest kid anywhere he went, and always knew his sights would always be limited in a racist society. Same was true for many other major civil right leaders. 

Julian Bond was the son of a university professor and university librarian. 

Ella Baker received a university education, finishing first in her class. 

Dianne Nash was from a middle class family and went to college. 

Stokely Carmichael was the son of West Indian “model immigrants,” attended an elite New York City magnet school and went on to university.  

Even Malcolm X, one of the few who could claim truly working class origins, was the son of a man who was a relatively well-off community leader until he was chased from one town to another by white supremacist groups and finally killed in a car wreck, possibly at the hands of one of the groups that was after him. Malcolm was super smart, and if he didn’t already have a chip on his shoulder, he got one when a white teacher told him blacks couldn’t be lawyers, which had been his dream. He gave up school, seeking greatness first in crime, then in revolution.

Am I actually saying that the entire history of the left and social movements has been driven by jealous petit bourgeois wanna-bes? Well, yeah — of course! 

But: in 21st century America, as a privileged kid who nevertheless has a chip on your shoulder, you are actually in a fundamentally different position than all those revolutionaries I just listed. All them had no other choice — they were greats in times and places that offered them only one path to greatness: revolution. 

Nowadays, if you’re American and you have a somewhat decent university degree, and all you want is a shot at great “success” — then you should go to Wall Street, Silicon Valley or Hollywood. Your chances of achieving greatness through politics are exactly 0.000000001%. So what the hell do you think you’re doing?

You see, this is exactly what makes you different. You’re not a Fidel or a Che. You are better. If you look closely, you’ll see they were arrogant, self-absorbed, power hungry bastards. Yeah, they sincerely wanted the best for humanity, and were willing to give their lives for it. But so are you. The difference is that, for you, it’s all about the cause and not about you. 

Here’s what you want: You want to be part of a naturally unfolding movement that is very nice and smooth and leaderless, in which solutions come not out of your head but bubble up from below and all decisions are made through quasi consensus. 

And that is what makes you so dangerous. You’re not in it for yourself. That sounds so nice. But actually, those good intuitions are liable to set you up as a road block — or a land mine — for people’s movements. 

In fact, the primary reason you don’t see people’s movements rising up all around you in the face of insane injustice and depravation is that people exactly like us are blocking the way. Out of the kindness of our hearts, we middle class, university educated people have been taking over — or preemptively starting — organizations of/for poor and working class people for almost 100 years in America. Or funding them — making sure (without even noticing) that the money goes to other university educated people. 

Did I mention that only about 20% of Americans have a four-year undergraduate degree? I just remembered I need to mention that because a lot of university educated people assume that “everyone” has gone to a four year college. 

So what’s so bad about university educated people. Well, the problem in America today is that college educated people have been carefully trained in a way of thinking that negates The Dream. 

You’ve gotten it from several directions, not just from your formal schooling. If you grew up in a middle class, wealthy or even aspirational working class family, then you got it from your dad’s lecturing that deeply infects your thinking even if you think you’re a rebel. You also got it from making friends with and dating other middle class and wealthy people. 

With all that going on in your head, and all those relationships, are you really going to embrace a radical politics that will endanger your friends’ position in society? And would you do that when it goes against everything you’ve been taught by all your professors — and your dad!?

No you’re not going to. And that’s a problem. 

It doesn’t mean you need to shrink even further from leadership. It means you need to embrace The Dream, not the cause of “helping poor people.” Because no people has ever been liberated by someone who wanted to “help” them. They liberate themselves, through revolution, with leadership. If you relinquish your class position, and sign on in solidarity with the whole human race, and make your life’s work true liberation of your newly adopted group, then you’ll do ok, because that means working for The Dream. (And I know you still don’t know what I exactly mean by that -- but read on. The next chapter will help. And other chapters after that.)

If, on the other hand, you seek to “help [other] people,” without consciously switching class allegiance, then you’ll spend your life struggling for one two-bit, harmless reform after another, in the name of the [other] people, for a nice fat middle class salary.

And that’s not cool. You really shouldn’t do that.

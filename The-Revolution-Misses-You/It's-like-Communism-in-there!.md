“It’s like communism in there. I’m telling you: it is communism.”

The worker was sitting on a rocking chair next to her television, which was turned on very loud to some crazy talk show. I was sitting on her couch. I had come calling as a union organizer. And she was telling me about her job in capitalist America. 

Communism was: her boss humiliating her coworkers daily, cutting their pay without any warning or reason, and the knowledge that there was nothing to stop him from firing her if she resisted, or even if she didn’t. 

I turned down the TV. I got her to sign a union card. She promised to come to the next meeting. She was ready to defeat workplace communism by fighting for a union. 

There are hundreds of different ideological Americas. Often — not always — it’s just people using different words for the same things. In eight years working as a union organizer, I heard dozens of workers describe their capitalist jobs as “communism.” Communism meant arbitrary, often cruel, power. “Capitalism” stood for freedom and rights. In college, with all my left wing professors and activist friends, I had been brought up with the exact opposite definitions. 

My job was not to change the way people thought about this word or that word, it was to organize unions. But over the years, hanging out with organizing committee members and talking with thousands of workers on in their living rooms and porches, I learned a lot about the many different ideological worlds in which working class Americans live out their rich intellectual lives.

My first union organizing job was in Allentown, Pennsylvania. At the time, it was just as depressing as the Billy Joel song made it sound. They played the song pretty much constantly all through my junior high years:

Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line.

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got.
but something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face, oh oh oh.

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down.
But I won't be getting up todaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy
aaaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaaah.

The steel workers who found jobs found them in Walmarts, Burger Kings and nursing homes.  Nursing homes were booming because there were all these old people who had retired from Steel with their fat pensions intact before the Great Dismantling. 

One janitor at the big nursing home we were organizing told me how he lost his job:
“After a year of negotiations, we had gradually given in on everything: pay cuts, health care, work rules, schedules, everything. The day before the vote to ratify this disgusting, humiliating contract, they came back with another 10% cut in pay. Instead of voting for the contract, we voted to strike. 

“They closed the plant, just like we knew they would. But there’s this guy you have to look in the mirror every morning. I wanted to be able to look at a human being there. They were going to close that plant no matter what. They needed to be able to blame it on us. And I needed to say, Fuck You.” 

So many people in Allentown were working two or three jobs, and constantly panicked that their hours might get cut at any one. Many of the adult workers I visited still lived with their steel worker retiree parents to make ends meet. The workers in our nursing home actually made far-above-average wages. They were organizing against impending pay cuts and also increasingly drastic understaffing. For the old steel workers, and daughters and sons of steel workers, it was like: “Here we go again.”

We worked up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week for the first three months of the campaign. After that, we started getting Sundays off. Coming from four years of luxurious and lazy college life, it was like I had been ripped from a cozy warm bed and plunged into a tank of ice water. One of the other kids in my organizer apprenticeship program complained about the hours on the second day and was fired on the spot.  

It was perfect. The thrill of working harder than I ever thought possible, of acquiring new skills each day, of having my mind blown open in totally unpredictable ways each day — it was exactly what I had needed all along without knowing it. I wished I could go back and do college over this way and learn six languages.

You couldn’t knock on doors after about six o’clock on Friday and Saturday nights. So the other organizers and I would go over to dinner with or go out with workers from the organizing committee. We had to do it kind of in secret, because our boss had a rule against becoming friends with the workers. 

I hung out with the Christians from day shift, the queer folks from evening shift, and the druggies, cultists and preppers of night shift. 

Here’s one thing I learned right away about the politics of American workers: They all believed America was fucked, and they were ready to support any drastic plan to fix it. 

You know those polls that come out every now and then that say something like 40% of America supports socialism? Those people don’t actually think socialism is good. Like the worker above, they think it’ll mean giving up their rights and bowing down to some kind of dictator — but they don’t care: they’re ready to try anything. 

When we got to talking about politics, I would pitch folks on an option other than freedom-robbing “socialism” or “communism.” Since then, I’ve been doing this consistently wherever I go, with whomever I’m working and socializing. (Which, since that first organizing job, has now been 21 years! Geez.) 

My pitch is this: Why not rebuild our industry? I mean — the point wouldn’t be to rebuild the exact industries we lost, but what if we built a modern economy that allowed us to make the most valuable things that we and the rest of the world wants? For example, all these gadgets we use — phones, tablets, laptops — and all the high tech machines use to make those things: we are not buying those things stuff from sweatshops in Bangladesh, but from high-wage factories in Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Korea and now China. Some idiot politicians and bankers decided a long time ago that it was a good strategy for us to stop investing in our capacity to make that kind of stuff — and to start investing in other country’s capacity to make it. The people in Korea, China and many other countries were smart and took our bankers and politicians up on their offer to finance the building new modern economies. So here’s my pitch: let’s now build ourselves a modern economy again — one with room for hundreds of millions of workers to do good jobs and earn a good living. Let’s just build that. What is stopping us?

The response to that pitch among workers was almost always the same: “Hell yeah! …but what’s stopping us is those politicians and bankers.” 

The only workers who would answer differently were those who had gone to college, taken Econ 101 or who were committed armchair laissez-faire ideologues. Those workers would ask they same questions that all college educated people, even left wingers, ask without fail: Are you talking about the government building those industries? You’re not talking about state owned industries are you? How in the world do you propose to pay for it all? Why industry? — don’t you know that we’re living in a knowledge economy and making stuff is for losers?

Right wingers stop there. But left wingers continue on with more questions: Who will decide what industries to build? Who will own them? How will workers have a voice over their work? 
Why don’t workers ask those questions? It’s not because they are uneducated or simple minded, it’s because they already know the answers — because they’re obvious to anyone who hasn’t been brainwashed by the middle-classification process of going to college. (Be patient, my college educated friends: a big chunk of the book will be answering those questions.) 
In our union campaign at the big Allentown nursing home, however, we weren’t organizing for a new economy. We were just organizing against pay cuts. 

Management did what management always does: They hired a very highly paid and talented union busting firm. The firm set up shop inside the home retrained the managers in union busting techniques, and put up big wall charts to track the positions of every individual worker. They figured out who the most important leaders were, and then coached and required each manager to use their sometimes decades-old personal relationships with those leaders to turn them around. When that wasn’t enough, they offered bribes in the form of promotions and perks. When that wasn’t enough, they made threats. The workplace had been converted into a totalitarian police state, and just enough leaders had been picked off to bring the union’s initial 75% majority down to about 50%. 

The union election, after a grueling six month hell-on-earth campaign, was going to be won or lost by a few votes. The entire Northeast was hit on the day of the election with the worst ice storm — an ice storm! — in a decade. It was a complete disaster. We were frantically driving workers to the polls in our little rental cars. Management was driving them to work in a large fleet of SUVs. 

My last knock and drag was was a worker who lived in the boonies. As we drove in, slipping and sliding all over the road, she talked about the union. To her it was nothing. The union campaign had been a tremendous disruption that, despite supporting it, she had done her best to ignore To her, the question of whether she’d have a union or not was slightly more important than whether she’s have waffles for breakfast, and far less important than whether her cable provider would finally add VH1. 

And she was right. The union probably wouldn’t make any huge difference. Maybe it would be able to fend off a little bit of the pay cuts, for a little while. But she’d have no control over that and she knew it. Was it worth the hassle? Maybe. But not for her. 

Out of around 800 votes, we lost by about ten.

Over the course of the campaign, as I had been warned I would, I did see friendships torn apart among the workers. I did have organizing committee members slam the door in my face after telling me I had ruined their life. I also saw workers take on the cause of the union as their own. They worked together. They challenged power. They were trying to build something important, and natural — something they had already been building long before we got there: power in the place where they spent the bulk of their time and energy, power not only for themselves, but for the helpless residents who they they cared for.

And we ruined it. We took that good and natural process of power-building at work, a process that was in fact doomed to fail without some delivery of external resources; we inserted ourselves right into the middle of it, taking leadership over it, disrupting it; we raised the hopes of some and massively pissed off others; and we fucked the whole thing up.     

I left Allentown a scorched and smoking battleground behind me. It would take the workers years to get back to normal. I had barely a scratch on me.

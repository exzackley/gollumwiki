Whether you want to call it communism or capitalism, a new system has seized humanity. We have to get our heads around it: what it is, how it works and where it came from — all in just a few pages, because we have so much other stuff to talk about in this book.

A lot of people these days assume that capitalism means a system in which a few people have all the money and power and lord it over everyone else. But the world was that way long before capitalism began. Capitalism is actually a system in which people — even the rich and the powerful — lose their ability to control the economy because they are replaced by numbers. That’s right: tyrannical numbers! Maniacal, singleminded numbers that only want one thing: to increase.

Before capitalism, people lived under many different kinds of economic systems in different places. They were rooted in traditions and institutions that evolved slowly over time — except when they evolved very quickly, like when they were blown up by wars, revolutions and ambitious reformers.

In all of those pre-capitalist systems, people in power positions kept the wheels turning and defended the systems from threats. In the late Roman Empire, for example, local leaders collected around 2/3 of farmers’ grain, taking a cut before distributing the rest up the hierarchy of Roman administration until the last portion finally reached the Emperor’s own enormous granary (which Roman locals called “Jaws!”). Anyone failing to do their duty anywhere along that vast supply chain were in trouble. For those toward the bottom of the chain, trouble meant torture and death. 

That Roman system was an economic system, but not a capitalist system. The purpose of the system was to keep the empire running, to keep the Emperor(s) in charge, to support the military, to keep the powerful Roman aristocracy happy and, as a lesser consideration, to keep the bulk of the people from starving. Wealth, and therefore power, came from the land — and therefore depended on control over the land. Control over land was determined by politics, war and intrigue.

Emperors and lower leaders often got ideas about how to change the system. They were free to try to change the system in any reasonable or wacky way they chose. An emperor might say one day that the tax on the peasants was too low — bleed them dry! Or he might say it was too high. It was up to him.

The first reformer in recorded history was Urukagina, ruler of the city of Lagash in Sumeria almost five thousand years ago. He lowered taxes, which had become so extreme as to demand children for payment. Strategically redesigning the whole system, he wiped out the entrenched class of tax collectors, granting amnesty to their debtors. He slashed the parasitic bureaucracy that had grown up, and forbade its officials from anymore seizing peoples land or possessions. He stripped the corrupted priestly class of all official power. 

According to a tablet from Urukagina’s reign, “Everywhere from border to border, no one spoke further of priest-judges…. The priest no longer invaded the garden of the humble man. He freed the inhabitants of Lagash from usury… hunger, theft and murder.” 

“The widow and the orphan were  no longer at the mercy of the powerful,” the tablet reads, “He established amagi,” which probably meant something similar to Hebrew’s Shalom: a systemic peace, freedom from fear, and repaired world. Literally, it meant “return to the mother.” 
The guy just did it. What he said went. 

Before capitalism, a leader could sometimes hold history still if he wanted to. That’s the answer to why China didn’t take over the world. It had the power to do so centuries before Europe. Around the year 1400, merely out of curiosity, the Chinese Emperor sent a fleet to explore the world. Kind of on a “five year mission to explore new worlds and new civilizations” — and to give away gifts, establishing diplomatic and trading contacts. 

If you haven’t already read about China’s “Treasure Fleet” somewhere else, you’re going to have a hard time believing me that this thing existed. If you can’t believe me, go look it up. The fleet was commanded by the muslim nobleman, Zheng He. (Four hundred years before the end of the Spanish Inquisition, China was allowing freedom of worship to most religions.) Almost all of the hundreds of ships in the fleet were larger than any of Columbus’s three puny vessels. More than sixty of the ships were longer than 450 feet — about as long as a 30 story building, and nine times the length of Columbus’ three ships that departed Andalusia a century later. No navy matched Zheng He’s until World War I.

So why didn’t China take over the world? Because its emperors decided not to. 
The Treasure Fleet gave away gifts and collected gifts, dropped off ambassadors and collected ambassadors, kings and queens from dozens of lands all the way to Africa. After a few of these massive operations, the only thing that really impressed the Emperor was a giraffe that made the trip all the way back from southeastern Africa. It soon died. 

The program was canceled. The only thing the voyages seemed to be creating was a competing center of power around the navy that might disturb the imperial system that had been carefully preserved for centuries. The emperor recycled the ships and burned nearly all records of the program. The emperors had the freedom to decide not to take over the world because, for better or worse, humans were still in charge. 

Capitalism would change all that.

Capitalism began when advanced technology leaked out of empires and states in Asia and the Middle East where it had been tightly controlled and into the swirling, uncontrolled chaos of medieval Europe. 

Just as today all hell sometimes breaks loose when advanced weapons and other technologies become available in regions without strong political institutions, the same happened in Europe when advanced Asian and Middle Eastern technology fell into the hands of barbarian warlords, who we today look back and call kings, princes and feudal lords.

In Europe, determined explorers — like Columbus — could shop around until they found a prince or princess to sponsor their adventures. Hundreds such private investors were free to sponsor exploration. Almost none of them did. The decentralized structure of Europe, however, allowed for the few who went for that sort of thing to do as they pleased. 

Once a few investors made their first profits by bringing back treasure from far off lands, the practice caught on and eventually turned into a frenzied race for colonial conquests. It wasn't yet capitalism, but wealth in terms of numbers (e.g. pounds of gold and silver) were being compared and an almost involuntary race for more among many princes was in motion. 

In China (and other highly centralized large countries such as, at different times in their histories: Japan, Korea, Russia, France, and others), whenever strong central rulers saw self-possessed merchant and banking classes rising up, they wiped them out — successfully keeping at bay the capitalist weed, keeping themselves in charge, and keeping numbers in a subordinate position to human beings.

In Europe, however, when a really powerful merchant and banking class rose up, empowered by the imported technological advances, there was no central authority to stop it. Europe just had so many independent little principalities and states shooting off in their own directions — the merchant class was free to roam and opportunistically interact with all of them. The many states did not all go in the same direction. They went in all kinds of wildly different directions. This was the source of much change in the world. It’s where we got the Reformation and the Renaissance, for example. And also, finally, capitalism.

Capitalism was what happened when merchants and bankers added a new kind of venture to their repertoire of buying, selling, mining, looting and pillaging. The new venture was: production. 
The story of the rise of capitalism is a complex one if you want to know ever detail. But that’s not what we’re after here. Capitalism was a unique new system that rose up in Europe for producing, distributing and consuming goods. Let’s skip the details of how it was exactly born and fast-forward to when it was up and running. 

Capitalism is a process in which a substance called “capital” expands by cycling over and over again through a series of transformation. There is no first step, since the process is an endless loop. But if we start with money it goes like this:

Money is converted into the ingredients of production such as machines, raw material and labor. Then a magic wand is waved over them, in a workshop or factory, where the “production process” mysteriously takes place. Then, from the factory commodities come marching out! The commodities are then converted back into money as they are sold on the market, completing the cycle. It’s a perfect circle, except that there is more money at the end than there was in the beginning. So it’s really more like an expanding spiral — one that must eventually cover the entire world. 

The cycle can fail at any point. Just as many caterpillars in their chrysalises fail to become butterflies, many processes of production fail to produce sellable commodities. Even perfectly good commodities can fail to find buyers once they hit the market through no fault of their own, for example if the market is flooded with commodities with the same use value. 

Each successful cycle expands the total mass of capital — meaning that more and more people and resources are employed under capitalism. 

Capitalism was unprecedented in a number of ways. One of those ways was that numbers instead of people were in charge. Yes, production is run by people, and funded by people, and the countries in which capitalism grows are still run by people. 

But capital itself was liberated from the control of people. It flowed to wherever it felt it had the best chance of expansion, regardless of what people wanted. Capital belonging to pious Christian abolitionists flowed into the slave trade. Capital belonging to landed aristocrats poured into enterprises that were tearing up the way of life they treasured. Capital belonging to patriotic subjects flowed into arms manufacturing in enemy countries. This was because the capital didn’t belong to the people, the people belonged to the capital.

Capital was also liberated from the direct control of natural resources or geography. In other words, whereas a trading company’s mining was limited to the number of mines in its territory, capitalist production took place in factories that could be replicated to an unlimited extent. It’s true that capitalist production also relied on natural resources, but soon it seemed that all available resources in the world were being rushed to the factory gates.  

In a few states — Holland and England being the main ones — rulers hitched their carts to the driving force of capitalism, and did all sorts of things to help speed and strengthen its development. Everywhere that capitalism grew up, the state had played a huge role in its birth. It wasn’t long, however, before states realized they had created monsters and found themselves being taken over by capitalism and converted into organizations that existed primarily for the purpose of making the country and the world safe for capitalism. That’s not to say that they minded. The first capitalist societies quickly became so full of wealth and technology and new powerful weapons, that many other states sought to imitate them. Thus capitalism spread from country to country.   

This was a very new way for a system to grow. Empires grew through intentional conquest by leaders acting consciously against the will of others. It was an intentional act of domination by the few against the many. Capitalism, however, spread more like a really great idea, or a really terrible virus.

It’s important to understand how that expansion process really worked — and still works today. 
Think back to the Roman peasants I mentioned earlier. Each and everyone of them had a direct interest that was opposed to the empire which carried off 30% of their crops. People today, on the other hand, voluntarily hand over their money to the new “Jaws” of the stock market. Everyone — even those who object to the way the system works — is pouring every last dollar into the project of expanding capital and capitalism, because that’s where it grows.   

That is why hundreds of years of attempts at replacing capitalism one co-op at a time have failed. Most people these days have no idea how strong the many historical attempts to out-compete capitalism have been. The co-operative, social-capitalist and utopian separatist movements have been huge over the centuries. There was a time — that I’ll tell you about later in the book — when millions of Americans (a significant portion of the population at the time) was swept up in a vast movement to convert almost the whole economy up into cooperatives. 

All those movements were eventually washed away, but capitalism charged on. Is that because capitalism is invincible? No, it’s just because none of those movements had the same power of attraction that capitalism did over all the resources, labor and leadership of society. 

So that’s capitalism for you. Think before you knock it. It’s given you your MacBook Air, the Android supercomputer in your pocket, Amazon Prime, NetFlix, SmartWool and Sushi in Chicago. 

And what really, anyways, is the problem with capitalism? 

Actually, that is the wrong question. We shouldn’t hold any kind of grudge against capitalism. Capitalism is an overwhelming restructuring of humanity and the planet. In that sense it holds the same position in our history as fire and agriculture. Asking whether it is good or bad is equivalent to asking whether adolescence is good or bad. It’s a stage in our development. 

The correct questions are: Are we happy with the way things are with humanity now? And what do we want humanity to become? 

The answer, for me, and for Thomas Jefferson and Sojourner Truth, and the guy who lives at the end of my street is this: We want a different kind of world than the one we have today. We just want one where people (a) are free and (b) can make their own living so that they don’t have to beg some owner of land — or capital — to exploit them in exchange for a living. 

That’s what we want. It’s irrelevant to ask whether capitalism has gotten us closer to that dream or not. It has completely changed our understanding of what it means to be human. If we’re asking whether it was good that capitalism was born, we might as well ask whether it was good that we were born.

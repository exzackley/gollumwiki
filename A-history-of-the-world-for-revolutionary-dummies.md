## Human nature is: violent and peaceful, hateful and loving, competitive and cooperative.

- There was an original human way of life that lasted for hundreds (or at least tens) of thousands of years ever after we became biologically modern humans -- and millions of years before that for our pre-human ancestors. That original way of life was consistent in a bunch of crucial ways for all humans earth up until the development of agriculture. This was of life was both beautiful and terrible. It is dishonest to remember only the bad (e.g. Hobbs: "life was brutish and short") or to idealize the good alone (e.g. Rousseau).
- We are almost unique in our capacity for dramatic love, affection and passion and hatred, cruelty and violence.
- We are one of the only animal species that systematically kills its own kind. We're the only animal that tortures our own kind.
- Nevertheless, early humans we were beautiful creatures. We often lived in relatively stable, we developed amazing cultures, with breathtaking diversity across the planet.
- There was no one traditional human culture; some groups were cruel and harsh to their children, some kind; some groups were violent within their group, some extremely peaceful; etc...
- Even our economic way of life went in radically different directions from group to group, even before agriculture. The people of the Pacific Northwest of the present-day United States lived in relatively large groups that enjoyed the year-round abundance of their location. The people of Alaska , almost every individual made their life in a way that had a few things in common with everyone else on the planet: they made it themselves, pulling their own weight, in community with a small group of interdependent individuals.

## The first high tech revolution

### You're right to feel that our current way of life is in conflict with what it means to be human. But that goes all the way back to the invention of agriculture. Unless you want to go back to being hunter gatherers, then we need to look forward, with an eye to our origins, rather than idealize some village agrarian past.

- OK so actually there were high tech revolutions before this one. Fire. And Language. We're not really sure which came first. Those and other technological breakthroughs -- like clothing! -- changed what it mean to be human.
- But even those changes didn't change the basic shape of how we made a living, or the social structure of our tiny groups. The similarities between human groups and their internal structure are strikingly similar not only to our nearest cousins, Chimpanzees -- whom we diverged from EIGHT million years ago -- but also to gorillas, baboons and many many other primates with whom our common ancestor is 50 or even 100 million years ago.
- What does that mean? It means that we had a certain very stable way of life for a very long time -- millions and millions of years -- and that our physical and mental selves grew up to go along with that way of life.
- But then something crazy happened that turned our lives inside out. It forced a new way of life up us that conflicted with our hard-coded physical, emotional, mental make up in a bunch of serious and difficult ways.
- And that crazy something was agriculture.
- So yeah

## The rise of exploitation

### Everyone's talking about empire these days. Where'd it start? Empire is what happens when the original human nature is "empowered" by agricultural-era technologies.

- In other words, what happens is that some people decide to try to dominate -- just like they always wanted to, but now they can.
- Political scientists have a bunch of terms for the various stages of political organization. Here they are...

## The rise of Empire

### Empire comes with horses (or other animals that will make due), writing and other technologies. It's big and bad.

## But then comes religion as a human reaction to the injustice

### The Great Transformation. Something that -- might have/ should have -- held empire in check. In any case, it held out the promise of a check on empire that would one day much later be redeemed.

## The evolution of Empire

### How upstart, table-turning barbarians 

- The Mongols and the Chinese state
- Islam and the zones it took (i.e. in both Mongol and Islam cases, modernity comes from the interaction between the established states and the upstart "egalitarian"/revolutionary soldiers.)
- Gotta mention Ashoka
- Europe by the way was a backwater. 


## When did Europe start being different? Not with humanism.

### The kind of "civility" and "humanism" can be found all over the world way earlier than Europe.

- China
- Japan
- India
- Arab world
- Africa
- Americas
- Where else?

### It was thanks to the development of a new and powerful means of production that Europe (and North America) was able to deliver really amazing "humanist" way of life.

### Land Land Land

- Land in England
- Land in North America
- Trading in Netherlands and some other European cities.
- Incredibly ridiculous level of productivity

## A new kind of revolution

### BUT...Christianity did have something new. A radicalism that preached to love ones enemies. Eventually this came back to bite the elites. Was revolution for "the people" new? Was that a new idea? Can I say that it rose up with the new means of production or should I just say it rose up and not try to assign an explanation?

- Holland?
- England
- Reformation?
- U.S.
- France
- Haiti
- Spanish America
- China?? (Taiping?)
- Russia
- China again
- Whole rest of world
- can't fit things into super narrow/neat categories because there was just a lot of chaos.

## Early America

### This is what first happened in our country...and it is amazing. We should be proud.

- Land land land
- Development of capitalism/ means of production
- Several different cultures settled America
- Revolution to preserve the status quo, which was kind of awesome for a whole lot of people, relative to the rest of the world
- 

### Why does all the good always need to be wrapped up in all the bad? 

- Jefferson -> Jackson and... 
- The Civil War

## The Gilded Age -- the intensification of capitalism; the rise and fall of the populists.

## A couple of world wars and the ground laid for the civil rights and women's and gay movements. 

## The tragedy of the 60's

## Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Bush 1, Bush 2 and the Last Temptation of America

## The Great Dismantling of America

## The Machine Age and Humanity's slingshot 

### Not really, but maybe soon.

- Computers allowed everyone to publish their own blog. But the printing press did that ages ago (stats on newspapers).
- Computers are connecting people. But that happened before...with boats (50,000 ago), writing (4,000 ago), roads (3,0000 ago), rail, telegraph & telephone.
- Allowing protests. But 1848 etc...
- However...something huge is coming -- that really will change everything, will again completely what it means to be human. It may even eliminate humanity. 

## What an American can do

- Revolution

> When we place ourselves in the position of contemporaries at the start of the period, as we will do in chapter 3, it becomes clear that any number of things could have gone wrong, as they had in the 1920s and 1930s. That they did not go wrong now reflected the fact that Europe possessed a set of institutions singularly well suited to the task at hand.  (location 26)

> The institutions of the command economy had severe limitations, as we will see, but they were best suited to the circumstances of catch-up growth.  (location 28)

> By extensive growth I mean growth based on capital formation and the existing stock of technological knowledge. It is the process of raising output by putting more people to work at familiar tasks and raising labor productivity by building more factories along the lines of existing factories. 7 Intensive growth, in contrast, means growth through innovation. 8 A larger share of the increase in output is accounted for by technical change, and less by the growth of factor inputs. 9  (location 29)

By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States had assumed a significant lead in GDP per capita by harnessing its endowments of land and resources and pioneering mass-production methods.

> The U.S. government, for its part, did not attempt to stifle the dissemination of new technologies in order to husband its competitive advantage. 19 Instead it encouraged European officials, managers, and labor leaders to visit U.S. factories in conjunction with the Marshall Plan to see for themselves how production was organized on the shop floor. Technology transfer requires  (location 48)

> Technology transfer proceeded even more smoothly than these standard indicators would suggest because of the “fit” between the knowledge to be transferred and what might be called the European system of technology transfer. In the countries of continental Europe, education and training were heavily vocational. The majority of upper secondary students passed through vocational programs or apprenticeship training where they were schooled in the use of tools and equipment. Europe’s educational system was thus tailored to a situation where the task was to assimilate existing techniques rather than to create new ones. It prepared workers for deciphering the blueprints and operator’s manuals that accompanied the machinery and equipment embodying the advanced technologies of the time. 21  (location 49)

> Authors such as Charles Kindleberger, writing in the 1960s, also emphasized the growth of the labor force. 23 From 1947 through 1950, nearly one million persons of German and Polish ethnicity, many with extensive training and skills and of prime working age, moved from Eastern to Western Europe. In the 1950s, Western Europe’s labor supply was augmented by additional ethnic German refugees from Central and Eastern Europe, French repatriates from Algeria, returning Dutch colonists from the former East Indies, and Southern European guest workers in Switzerland and France. Britain admitted 350,000 Irish workers between 1946 and 1959 and more than 540,000 Indians, Pakistanis, and West Indians between 1955 and 1968. Although the first members of the postwar baby boom generation started entering the labor market only in the late 1960s, immigration loosened labor market constraints in the meantime.  (location 50)

> It is tempting to credit the Keynesian revolution for this newfound stability. 27 But in fact there was little active use of monetary policy. And given the lags in adjusting fiscal policy to economic conditions and the difficulty of tailoring spending by public enterprises to the cycle, fiscal impulses were often destabilizing. 28 Electoral  (location 52)

> You try telling Winnie Madikizela-Mandela what to do… (location 550)

> is ANC royalty Max Sisulu and the leader of the opposition is the DA’s rising star Lindiwe Mazibuko. Name their equivalents in the NCOP if you can… (location 569)

> Minister of Justice Jeff Radebe. (location 687)

> down to “merit” versus “transformation”. Which is often bollocks, because you cannot say that Pius Langa or Dikgang Moseneke were not appointed on merit. They were simply the best brains in the country. (location 698)

> The perfect example of this is Jeremy Gauntlett, who is seen by many as the best advocate in the country (by miles). (location 701)

> politicians, so don’t think for a moment that the ANC is likely to give up any of its influence here. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng Born: 14 January 1961 Chief Justice of South Africa; God’s choice to head our judiciary (location 713)

> With gay-rights activists to the left, supporters of Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke to the right, and the usual anti-Zuma campaigners all about, Mogoeng was stuck in the middle of the biggest judicial ruckus in years. Part of the problem was that he had dissented in a case relating to images of homosexual sex and hadn’t provided his legal reasons for doing so (as he is compelled to by law). He had also dissented in a defamation case involving that most controversial of policemen, Robert McBride, and written that “dignity” and “freedom of expression” carried equal weight. Which, as it so happens, they do not. (location 726)

> The Constitution doesn’t mind judges being religious so long as their first duty is to the Constitution. But Mogoeng is a member of a holy fire-breathing brand of reborn religion that sometimes seems to suggest a duty to Christ overrides everything else. (location 735)

> Likely future To date, Mogoeng has made no hugely contentious judgments as chief justice, and he has plenty of critics looking closely for them. But he is in this job until 2021, guaranteed. He literally has to die or go to jail to be replaced before then. The quiet won’t last. At some point there will be a huge controversy involving him and possibly his beliefs. (location 737)

> The Presidency The office of the president; the apex of our governing system; where Zuma goes to work; a place with good lawyers Despite the fact that it is in charge of the entire country, the Presidency is actually not that large a department. It is situated in the Union Buildings in Pretoria, which is where Jacob Zuma goes to work most mornings. When in Cape Town, he goes to Tuynhuys. (location 742)

> Technically, the Presidency includes four “political principals”: the president, the deputy president (currently Kgalema Motlanthe; doesn’t have much to do these days), the Planning minister (Trevor Manuel) and the Performance minister (Collins Chabane). While they don’t all share an office, they probably do bump into each other at teatime. (location 746)

> The person who really seems to call the shots in Zuma’s office is Lakela Kaunda, who’s been one of his closest aides for many years. (location 750)

> The Spear saga, (location 771)

> When he was jailed by the apartheid state he didn’t bend on Robben Island; he came back for more, taking important roles within the ANC in exile and then running Operation Vula in KZN. (location 783)

> His ejection of Julius Malema from the party has led to the formation of the Economic Freedom Fighters and his tolerance of corruption helped to create Agang. (location 859)

> He picked Cyril Ramaphosa to be his running mate for Mangaung, thus ensuring he became deputy president of the ANC. (location 882)

> The most likely outcome is that Ramaphosa will be appointed deputy president of the country, which would be an indication that Zuma wants him to take over in 2019. If not, then the other likely contender is his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. (location 885)

> Mac Maharaj Born: 22 April 1935 Presidential spokesperson and spin-doctor-in-chief; Zuma’s greatest defender; political force of nature; tainted liberation hero (location 891)

> Operation Vula. (location 904)

> Maharaj was deployed to Zambia by the ANC, and won election onto its National Executive Committee in 1985. And then he went right back into South Africa, secretly, as part of Operation Vula. Unbelievably dangerous work, this was the bid to try to infiltrate some of the ANC’s top leaders back into the country so they could mobilise more opposition to apartheid. (location 910)

> Maharaj’s current position has to do with this one fact: he went underground, along with Mo and Yunus Shaik and Pravin Gordhan, and the person they all reported to was the head of ANC Intelligence, Jacob Zuma. Had they been caught they would have faced the worst kind of torture, and so they had to be hugely loyal to each other. It really explains the trust that Zuma has in Maharaj now. (location 913)

> Pravin Gordhan MINISTER OF FINANCE The voice of prudence within government; the man who pays the bills Department budget R21.6 billion In charge of the most powerful department in Cabinet, Pravin Gordhan is a former SACP member, who was very active in KwaZulu-Natal. As mentioned earlier, he was involved in Operation Vula with Zuma and Mac Maharaj during the ’80s, which gives him considerable pull in today’s government. It’s clear that he still has Zuma’s ear, and that when he makes certain pronouncements he knows his political back is covered. The other reason for his political confidence is that it would be very difficult for Zuma to replace him. Gordhan has a credible voice on the international stage and inspires confidence in the global business community. If he were to leave the position it’s entirely possible the rand would lose substantial value. In other words, he has assumed Trevor Manuel’s title and reputation. (location 1004)

> Aaron Motsoaledi MINISTER OF HEALTH Healer of our broken health system; fixer of our wrong Aids policies; the most accessible man in Cabinet Department budget R27.6 billion If someone had to ask who had done the most for the country while in Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet, Aaron Motsoaledi would be the guy with the big silver trophy. Almost a political unknown before 2009, he has been the person who has worked exceptionally hard at, and been exceptionally honest about, what needs to be fixed in our country. (location 1036)

> Jeff Radebe MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT Cabinet veteran; key to the JSC; power player Department budget R13.1 billion Jeff Radebe is South Africa’s only politician to serve in every Cabinet since originally being appointed by Nelson Mandela back in 1994. Considering all the changes within the ANC during that time, that’s quite a feat. (Trevor Manuel comes close, having been first appointed in 1996.) And right now he probably wields the most power he has ever had, considering the current situation in the justice system. Radebe joined the ANC while studying in the late ’70s, before leaving the country on ANC orders. Arrested in the mid-’80s and accused of terrorism offenses, he was represented by the late Pius Langa, who was practising as an advocate at the time. (Radebe had grown up with Langa’s younger brother.) He spent several years on Robben Island, and was released after Mandela in 1990. (location 1059)

> MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES Tina Joemat-Pettersson Department budget R5.8 billion Joemat-Pettersson has found it difficult to stay out of the news, following a trip to Sweden in 2010 that possibly was or wasn’t a holiday. Urgently called home by the president, she spent more than R150,000 on flights for herself, her kids and the au pair. The Public Protector has suggested, rather strongly, that she (location 1082)

> MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE Paul Mashatile Department budget R2.7 billion Mashatile is the leader of the ANC in Gauteng, one of the few provinces that voted against retaining Zuma at Mangaung. As such, he’s one of Zuma’s most powerful public enemies, someone Zuma would probably prefer to remove from office if he didn’t fear the reaction from the province. Mashatile is hugely popular in Gauteng, having led the province for many years, but he has been passed over for the post of premier, which he’s always craved. He is still angry about it. (location 1094)

> disputes that can arise when our culture is discussed, and was one of the (few) sober ANC voices during The Spear controversy in 2012. (location 1099)

> MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION Angie Motshekga Department budget R16.3 billion Motshekga is the minister South Africans love to hate at the moment. She’s had to carry the can for the Limpopo textbooks disaster, which saw pupils there without books for the entire 2012 school year. This resulted in huge public outrage, with a multitude of calls for her head. Motshekga herself admitted that year that half a million books ordered by her department had simply not been received, let alone distributed, while newspaper reports suggest that the “universal coverage” she had promised by 2014 just isn’t going to happen. Then one of her officials signed a deal with the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) that saw teachers receiving increases she couldn’t afford. Despite this, Motshekga appears to have Zuma’s full support. (location 1102)

> MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS Yunus Carrim (location 1117)

> Department budget R1.7 billion Carrim was appointed to Cabinet in July 2013, taking over a department that has been helmed by a number of underperforming and/or controversial ministers. Ever wondered why South Africa’s internet speeds are more than three times slower than the global average? This is the department responsible, and Carrim’s predecessor, Dina Pule, is currently under investigation, having been fired by Zuma when boyfriend-related corruption and nepotism allegations emerged. (location 1118)

> MINISTER OF COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS Lechesa Tsenoli Department budget R54.7 billion Tsenoli was appointed in July 2013 to head the department responsible for managing the relationships between national, provincial and local governments. It may not be the most influential portfolio, but it sure comes with a massive budget – only Social Development and Police have more to spend – which largely goes as grants to municipalities around the country. Tsenoli took over from the axed Richard Baloyi. Previously he had spent a long stint as deputy minister at Rural Development and Land Reform, where he had been a sober voice. Another SACP appointee, he came into front-line politics through the SA National Civics Organisation, and played a role in the youth politics of the 1980s. (location 1129)

> MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES S’bu Ndebele Department budget R17.7 billion Ndebele is the former premier of KwaZulu-Natal, where he had the distinction of being probably the only ANC member in that province who (location 1136)

> MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula (location 1144)

> Department budget R37.5 billion There was general surprise when Mapisa-Nqakula was given one of the country’s key Cabinet positions – mainly because she did such a poor job at Home Affairs under Mbeki. She was also asleep at the wheel while leader of the ANC Women’s League, not noticing that it was going to support Zuma in 2007, rather than her candidate, Mbeki. (location 1145)

> MINISTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Ebrahim Patel Department budget R700 million Patel is a Leftie, with a capital L, and makes no bones about it. The former leader of the South African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union, he firmly believes in state intervention in the economy. As minister, he led the charge to impose stricter conditions on Walmart’s purchase of Massmart (Game and Makro stores), saying it posed a threat to local industry. At one point, he even suggested that government should cap the salaries of top executives. He has also proposed several economic plans that call for great unity in policy making, but his ideas have now all been superseded by the National Development Plan, the ANC’s current new grand plan to fix everything and make the trains run on time (see p96). One of Patel’s great successes is the greater energy of the Competitions Tribunal, which falls under his portfolio. It has become more aggressive, and started to take on cartels in our economy – something to be happy about. (location 1155)

> MINISTER OF ENERGY Ben Martins Department budget R6.8 billion Martins first entered Cabinet as Minister of Transport in 2012, but was there for only a year before being transferred to Energy. A former trade unionist, he tried to change the way South Africans behave on the roads, and now he has to convince us to save as much energy (location 1164)

> MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING Blade Nzimande – see p156. Department budget R31.5 billion (location 1173)

> MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS Naledi Pandor Department budget R5.3 billion Pandor is the woman in charge of your ID. She has a reputation for efficiency and for getting the job done. She is also seen as one of the old guard of government, having headed Education under Mbeki. As a result, she’s got the necessary experience to lead a department that comes under intense pressure from time to time. (location 1175)

> MINISTER OF HUMAN SETTLEMENTS Connie September Department budget R25.3 billion September is still relatively new to high office, having been appointed to Cabinet in July 2013 (taking over from the vanquished Motlanthe-supporting Tokyo Sexwale). She has a real rags-to-Cabinet tale, having come, literally, from the floor of a Western Cape textile factory through the union system to become a leader within Cosatu and then a member of parliament. People who knew her in her early years say she always had the demeanour of a leader, but was humble with it. She rose to prominence during several strikes in the textile sector (location 1189)

> during the late ’80s, when striking was still a very dangerous thing to do. She now has one of the toughest jobs in government. Urbanisation is happening so fast that there is simply no way government can build enough houses fast enough to keep up with the sky-high expectations of the public. Expect her to find it tough going. (location 1194)

> MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND COOPERATION Maite Nkoana-Mashabane Department budget R5.1 billion Despite being our ambassador to India, Nkoana-Mashabane was almost unknown outside of political circles before taking over what used to be the Foreign Affairs department in 2009. Coming from Limpopo, where she’d (location 1197)

> MINISTER OF LABOUR Mildred Oliphant Department budget R2.1 billion Oliphant is one of those ministers with a hugely important portfolio who is hardly ever seen in public. As the minister supposedly in the firing line for the problems within our labour system, particularly in the mining sector after the Marikana shootings of 2012, she has been particularly quiet. (location 1210)

> Oliphant is from KwaZulu-Natal, where she rose up the ranks of the provincial ANC. She has also been active within Cosatu. She came into Parliament in the class of ’94, and has mainly played roles within parliamentary bodies, while keeping a low profile. (location 1215)

> MINISTER OF MINERAL RESOURCES Susan Shabangu Department budget R1.2 billion Shabangu is one of those ministers who (location 1220)

> has spent almost her entire life in the liberation movement, working from 1980 onwards in various political formations: the Federation of South African Women, the Free Nelson Mandela Committee, Cosatu. She has been in charge of one of the most difficult portfolios since 2009, but she was famous before that for her comments, while deputy at the Safety and Security ministry, that police should “shoot the bastards” – the bastards being criminals. It was also claimed she’d raised her skirt after setting off a metal detector at an airport. She is not someone to mess with under any circumstances. (location 1222)

> MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES Malusi Gigaba Department budget R1.2 billion Gigaba is seen as one of the upcoming men of government, with the brightest of futures. He is young – under 40 when appointed to Cabinet – and, it seems, hugely ambitious. He is also the best dresser in Parliament. (location 1252)

> rugby was racist and needed to transform. Attitude, yes. Julius Malema, no. (location 1258)

> In office Gigaba’s ambition has shone forth in claims that he wants to run half the country through the parastatals he controls. But, as the parastatals in question tend to hit the skids from time to time, he is also the person who has to smooth things over in public. He may well get bored of having to justify their (location 1261)

> massive mistakes. (See p114.) (location 1263)

> MINISTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION Lindiwe Sisulu Department budget R700 million When it comes to struggle heritage, it’s hard to touch Lindiwe Sisulu. The daughter of ANC legend Walter Sisulu and the sister of National Assembly speaker Max Sisulu, she has been in the corridors of power for many years and in Cabinet since the Mbeki era. She has served as minister in Housing, Intelligence and, under Zuma, Defence – which is where the wheels appeared to come off for a bit. (location 1271)

> MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS Thulas Nxesi Department budget R8 billion Nxesi is the man in charge of the stinking mess around the president’s home in Nkandla. If you hear that word, his name is unlikely to be too far behind. Nxesi rose through the political ranks at SADTU, going on to lead a large international teachers’ union federation. Eventually he was called by Zuma to come to Cabinet where, on his arrival, he found his department in a complete mess. Because it controls property and resources, Public Works is a department that’s easy to loot. Work costs can be inflated, money can go missing – and he has to carry the can. And because Public Works is also responsible for the accommodation of cabinet ministers, it’s often in the news for all the wrongs reasons – as when they end up staying in five-star hotels rather than in their official residences. (location 1285)

> MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND REFORM Gugile Nkwinti Department budget R8.9 billion For someone responsible for perhaps the country’s most contentious and controversial long-standing issue – land redistribution – Nkwinti has remained virtually silent since his appointment. He (location 1300)

> This could well be a calculated strategy. By talking up land redistribution, the ANC would only be building up hopes, which would probably then be dashed. As a result, the party needs to control the debate without letting it build up too much steam. Nkwinti has produced proposals to change land reform policies; however, at twelve pages long they were rather short on detail. He has now started to push for a “valuer-general” who would determine the value of land to be taken from farmers, to be given to those who lost it. (location 1305)

> MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT Bathabile Dlamini (location 1326)

^~Note: this is where I stopped reading the profiles

> She was heavily involved in turning the League against Mbeki and towards Zuma in 2007 – so no surprises, then, that she’s from KwaZulu-Natal. (location 1329)

> Trevor Manuel Department budget R1 billion Manuel is one of the longest-serving ministers in post-democratic South Africa, having led the Finance ministry for 13 years under Mandela, Mbeki and Motlanthe. During that time he established an international reputation for competence and prudence, and was known for his ability to control public finances. He also built up the capacity of the national treasury to ensure that our (location 1349)

> But Manuel was seen as tied to Thabo Mbeki; when Zuma won at Polokwane his star began to dim a little. In 2009 Zuma put him in charge of Planning, where he has created a well-received National Development Plan. The plan is relatively capitalist for a document coming from an ANC government, and contains several highly controversial suggestions. If it is actually implemented it could see Manuel’s influence lasting many decades into the future. (See sidebar.) (location 1356)

> The National Development Plan The NDP, the handiwork of Planning Minister Trevor Manuel, is South Africa’s new grand-master, slightly Chinese-style plan that will, over the coming decades, sort out the economy, make sure our children are educated and prepared for the future, and (location 1364)

> Nevertheless, Zuma himself used the ANC’s Mangaung conference to give the NDP his seal of approval, and the conference adopted the plan as official ANC policy. That isn’t going to stop its opponents from fighting its implementation, though, and already there are doubts about it being implemented, in whole or in part. (location 1373)

> MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY Rob Davies Department budget R9.1 billion Davies is from the SACP, and sometimes his communist beliefs show. He’s one of the men who tried to impose stricter conditions on the deal that saw Walmart buy Dions and Makro, and has appeared to interfere in business more generally. He is also responsible for trying to force all businesses in the country to register with their local municipalities. If you’ve ever spent time in your local council offices, you’ll know that’s probably the kiss of death for most smaller firms. Under pressure, he withdrew the Bill, but it still left a sour taste in the mouth of those who care for business. (location 1398)

> Davies spent part of the 1970s and all of the ’80s in exile. He’s a very senior member of the SACP and is on its top leadership body – which, despite this being the 21st century, is still called the Politburo. Up close, Davies can be abrasive, and he tries not to stand for any nonsense. But, unlike many other politicians the world over, if you ask him a question you will get a straight answer – and it won’t be based on the identity of the questioner. He’s one of those politicians who do actually think before they answer, and tries to give everyone a fair hearing. Don’t annoy him, though. He has a sharp tongue and he’s not afraid to use it. (location 1406)

> Premiers and provincial leaders Formally, premiers are elected to their posts by provincial legislatures, with the winning party thus effectively getting to choose the premier. Pretty straightforward. But it is ANC policy for its NEC to decide who the premier will be, and it instructs the legislature in question to vote accordingly. (location 1450)

> often doesn’t, for various political reasons. In Gauteng for example, the NEC didn’t want Paul Mashatile to be premier because he’s not a Zuma-ite, and so ordered legislature members to vote for Nomvula Mokonyane. The ANC also doesn’t announce who its candidate for provincial premier will be before elections – not the most transparent process. (location 1454)

> The Western Cape has the only non-ANC premier, Helen Zille. It, too, likes to mix up the premier and provincial leader. Its legislature voted Zille in after the DA made her its official candidate in that province, while the party leader in the province is Ivan Meyer. Eastern Cape Premier Noxolo Kiviet (location 1457)

> Sometimes those under the spotlight can obfuscate or delay, but in the end the will of the Chapter Nines must be done. It is this that gives them so much power – because, unlike so many other political entities in the country, they can actually access the information they need to thoroughly review a matter. For obvious reasons, Chapter Nine findings are usually made as public as possible, making it very difficult for them to be ignored. When Madonsela, as the public protector, released her report on the police headquarters leasing scandal in 2011, it indicated that then National Police Commissioner Bheki Cele and Public Works Minister Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde were guilty of corruption. Because these findings were public, Zuma was forced into acting; he fired them both. Also on her recommendation, he fired Cooperative Governance Minister Sicelo Shiceka, who was partial to the odd luxury trip at the taxpayer’s expense. (location 1527)

> Thuli Madonsela Born: 28 September 1962 The public protector; defender of the weak; student of corruption; one of the strongest independent voices in our democracy Thuli Madonsela has probably the softest voice of any public official in the southern hemisphere. When meeting her, the first question you ask yourself is, how can someone with one of the loudest voices in our cacophonic democracy be so quiet? How has she managed to not succumb to the South African disease of thinking that the louder you shout, the more important you are? In fact, unless you are listening closely, you may find yourself missing what she’s saying. And that would be a pity, because she is always worth listening to. (location 1570)

> and released findings that have forced Jacob Zuma to actually fire ministers, as well as a police commissioner. As a result, she has come under tough pressure from sections of Parliament. Her deputy, Kevin Malunga, has been publicly critical of her, leading to claims from ANC MPs that she is acting unilaterally. She also faced corruption allegations of her own in 2011; conveniently timed to coincide with her investigation into the police headquarters leasing scandal, they turned out, unsurprisingly, to be baseless. (location 1594)

> For the moment, Madonsela is one of those people who investigates like a bulldog and punishes through her quiet, well-chosen words. For the good of the country, let’s hope she is doing exactly the same thing in five years’ time. (location 1604)

> The dominant personality here, and later ANC president, was Pixley ka Isaka Seme, and one of his main priorities was to do away with the tribalism that had made it so difficult to (location 1679)

> unite black people in South Africa against colonial rule. (location 1681)

> After Rivonia the ANC went underground, and non-jailed senior members into exile, some to London and many to other parts of Africa. The armed struggle technically continued, but the ANC was forced to focus on campaigning for sanctions against apartheid, building up support around the world. Within South Africa resistance seemed to wither, hitting a nadir in 1967 with the death of its long-standing president, Albert Luthuli. The Nats would have had everyone believe that the ANC didn’t even exist. Famously, no photograph of Mandela reached the outside world, and his wife, Winnie, though banned to Brandfort in the Free State for many years, seemed to be a lone voice. While Tambo, Thabo Mbeki and others did their best from abroad, local protest was led by the Black Consciousness Movement and later the United Democratic Front. The Soweto riots of 1976 marked a tragic landmark in the struggle, as black schoolchildren protested new legislation that meant they would be taught in Afrikaans. And then came the turbulent ’80s as the townships erupted and the apartheid state entered its death throes. In 1990 FW de Klerk, having recently succeeded PW Botha, declared a change in policy, unbanning the ANC and releasing Mandela and others from jail. The ANC had won its great battle, and now came the time to govern. With Mandela in charge, it came into office in 1994, and it has remained there ever since. And there are plenty of smart people arguing about how long it will stay there for. (location 1707)

^~Note: great synopsis

> “During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.” – Nelson Mandela, Rivonia Trial, 1964 Luthuli (location 1723)

> All branches belong to geographical regions. Often these regions are not named after their areas, but people, so there’s the OR Tambo region in the Eastern Cape, for example. The size of a region can change vastly from place to place. The OR Tambo region is the second biggest in the country – so big that what it decides literally determines what the Eastern Cape ANC will do. (The biggest in the country is inevitably the eThekwini region around Durban.) (location 1745)

> When it comes to power at this level, size matters. Because the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has more members, it has more branches, and thus more delegates at elective conferences. This is why Jacob Zuma won so easily at Mangaung. KZN had so many votes that it was literally able to dictate the outcome. The only province that comes close to it in terms of numbers is the Eastern Cape. However it was divided on who to support, and in the end its leaders backed Zuma. This also means that some provinces are so small they hardly matter. The Northern Cape has very few ANC members, while the Western Cape, despite its concentrated population, also has a relatively small number of members. This means Luthuli House can safely ignore these provinces for the moment. (location 1751)

> The twelve types were all chosen by comparing each to the average U.S. county, a place populated by about 95,000 people with a median household income of about $37,000. Those people are 87 percent white, 9 percent African American, and 7 percent Hispanic. (Note that Hispanics, as far as the U.S. Census Bureau is concerned, can be of any race.) In the average U.S. county 11 percent of the families live in poverty and 15 percent live in mobile homes. Roughly 30 percent of people are employed in trade and service-sector jobs, 17 percent work in education, 16 percent work for some form of government, 15 percent work in manufacturing, 10 percent are self-employed, 7 percent are employed in agriculture, 5 percent are employed as professionals or executives, and 1 percent work in the military. In the average county 16 percent are enrolled in college. Using counties as our measure inflates the influence of farm and rural places because there are more rural counties than urban counties. But counties are advantageous in a lot of other ways—they are real “places” with their own governments and often their own subcultures. (location 318)

> As a result of the city government’s inability to supply water for some of the city’s residents, a thriving tank-truck industry has emerged that buys water from farmers and hauls it to the city’s thirsty residents.51 (location 909)

> Colorado has one of the world’s most active water markets. Fast-growing cities and towns in a state with high immigration are buying irrigation water rights from farmers and ranchers. In the upper Arkansas River basin, which occupies the southeastern quarter of the state, Colorado Springs and Aurora (a suburb of Denver) have already bought water rights to one third of the basin’s farmland. (location 921)

> Far larger purchases are being made by cities in California. In 2003, San Diego bought annual rights to 247 million tons (200,000 acre-feet) of water from farmers in the nearby Imperial Valley—the largest farm-to-city water transfer in U.S. history. (location 924)

> tragedy. James Gasana, who was Rwanda’s Minister of Agriculture and Environment in 1990–92, offers some insights. As the chair of a national agricultural commission in 1990, he had warned that without “profound transformations in its agriculture, [Rwanda] will not be capable of feeding adequately its population under the present growth rate.” (location 979)

> I met ordinary people picking a way through the physical ruins toward a better life. I met small businessmen, real estate agents, city employees, some of whom were showing up for work and making a stab at getting something done. I fell in with a terrified alderman who met me at hamburger stands because he said that his office was bugged by organized crime or “the syndicate” as it was called then. I met another alderman who said nothing of the sort and was later found kneeling, his hands handcuffed (location 147)

> In the early 1940s Saul had used this prejudice to overcome Father Luigi’s objection to what would become a prototype for the nightmare of public housing. (location 157)

> Saul believed there was a place for the outside organizer. Moses was one of his favorites, Saint Paul another. (location 300)

> Saul believed that although once in a blue moon spontaneous organizational combustion happens and people come together on their own, more often they need the outside person who brings new views of familiar situations and convinces them of the possibility of change. Just any outsider will not do. Saint (location 302)

> Change will come from a mobilized grass roots. That’s what I’ll do, I’ll organize black folks. At the grass roots for change.1 (location 311)

> The organization commenced changing its name and with each new moniker it grew more dangerous. From the Blackstone Rangers it transmogrified into, among others, the Black P. Stone Rangers, the Almighty Black P. Stone Nation and the El Rukn Tribe of the Moorish Science Temple in America. Please (location 397)

> I doubt that Alinsky would have much use for it in the changed society we live (location 437)

> The least doctrinaire of men, he would in all likelihood be tinkering with new ways to realize the old goal of democratic self-rule. (location 437)

> “What community organization does is it comes along with a pair of scissors and one after another it quietly snips the wires attached to the buttons. When the guy hits the buttons, nothing happens and the battle is won.” (location 445)

> “I shall then walk up to the largest window in the plant, open it, divest myself of my outer raiment, remove my shirt and bare my bosom. Then when you order your troops to fire, mine will be the first breast that those bullets will strike.”5 (location 475)

> For Saul defeat was not a learning experience. It was a disaster. (location 482)

> He understood why Martin Luther King conducted his campaigns for the larger goals of national legislation, even though after King moved on to the next town he may have left the local people broke, in jail, naked to retaliation and vulnerable to firings and harassments. (location 488)

> but Saul was aware of how the locals may have paid dearly for such progress, joining, as one internal civil rights movement memo put it, “a string of embittered cities.”6 (location 490)

> John L. Lewis and Alinsky organized adults, people who had families, children, jobs, mortgages, doctor bills, all the responsibilities of being grown-ups. For an adult with responsibilities the loss of a paycheck is often a family catastrophe. Saul was not big on provoking arrests. (location 492)

> He used to say if you are going to get your people arrested, you’d better make goddamn sure you’ve got the bail money and the lawyers to get ’em out of jail. (location 495)

> Saul felt that while the getting-arrested tactic might be workable using teenagers, college students and that part of the clergy that has time on its hands for this modified form of martyrdom, with labor unions (location 498)

> As for staff getting arrested, Saul had an absolute prohibition. He would explain that a staff person cannot operate behind bars; besides the publicity that would come (location 501)

> be fully funded before they could be launched, which left him vulnerable to pressure by wealthy donors, and perhaps more serious, his belief that they should tackle only issues that were “winnable.” (location 511)

> Saul’s belief that in the long run people allowed to make their own decisions will make the right choice did nothing for the short run, which was a problem. In 1958 the only thing people in those southwest side districts wanted to hear from an organizer was a better way to keep their communities uniracial. (location 757)

> IAF organizers could not promise them that, but we could seem to without saying so and justify our manipulative misdirections because a strong, democratically governed community organization would be able to tamp down or suppress violence (location 759)

> To a greater or lesser extent we succeeded in doing that. In the process a lot of people got handled, jobbed, bamboozled and conned. They thought that they had a democratic organization, and in a way they did and in a way they didn’t. There were hundreds of meetings, conventions attended by several thousand people, all the mechanisms of self-rule, but everything concerning race, including the admission of black groups to the organization, was steered by Saul’s stealthy minions. In fact, the social justice skids were so well greased, staff had to work (location 762)

> with—I don’t know what to call them—the conservative or racial xenophobes or antiblack or potentially violent faction to ensure they were not shut out and left feeling unrepresented. To accomplish this end there was a small amount of judicious ballot-box stuffing, as I recall. It had to be done because we had to keep the antis in the organization. They validated the claim that the organization was truly representative of all groups and interests in the community, the source of power and credibility. (location 766)

> It was, however, a record based on surfing the curl of the wave. (location 898)

> King arrived in Chicago with a large staff, some of whom were very talented, some very not talented and some crazy as hoot owls, but all bickering with each other and climbing over each other so as to be closest to their leader. Saul’s staff did not bicker. (location 909)

> Our line to the people we were organizing was that as long as we are putting up the money, we get to make the final decisions. Raise your own money and show us the door. (location 941)

> The Achilles’ Heel of the civil-rights movement is the fact that it has not developed into a stable, disciplined, mass-based power organization. This needs to be said out loud. Many of the significant victories that have been won in civil rights were not the result of mass power strategy. They were caused by the impact of world political pressures, the incredibly stupid blunders of the status quo in the South and elsewhere and the supporting climate created particularly (location 952)

> Laudable as it is to volunteer to help other people wrestle with their problems, effective organizations are built with people who have a direct and personal interest in their success. (location 989)

> The task is to help the people build their own organization. (location 990)

> Ideally the outsider is the catalyst, the invisible element who starts the process and goes away, although in real life things do not go that smoothly. (location 990)

> The lumpen proletariat or the poorest of the poor are worthless for founding a functioning organization. (location 992)

> wreck of a slum building which was without heat and proclaimed that the Chicago Freedom Movement was putting it under “trusteeship” by virtue of “supralegal” moral authority. The rents owing to the landlord would be used to make repairs. An Alinsky operation working on the principle of “You must know where you are before you try to go someplace else” would have first found out who owned the building and what the owner’s circumstances were. The King people did no such thing and were embarrassed when it was discovered that the slum landlord was an invalid octogenarian who said he would give the building to anyone willing to take over the mortgage payments. (location 1009)

> “We wanted to do it illegally. . . . We want to be put in jail for furnishing heat and health requirements to people with children in the winter.”6 (location 1015)

> It was a balancing act: when their goals were the same as yours, there were none better and when their goals were different, there were none more disloyal. (location 1218)

> it. Suffice it to say, according to Alinsky, Lewis did decide that they had to be removed from their union positions at once. Trying to extract them by voting them out at the local union level or at annual conventions would have been the political equivalent of working a barbed spear from your flesh. (location 1221)

> Saul related that Lewis wanted him to supervise the job. He would be given temporary direction of Van Bittner’s goon squad. (location 1224)

> Thus equipped Saul visited five or six midwestern cities where the men on Lewis’s list were given the choice of leaving town or finding themselves in an “ash can.” I remember Saul’s use of the term “ash can” even when other details of the story have been forgotten. (location 1229)

> The led are seldom satisfied. (location 1258)

> Such tensions and rivalries are supposed to be relieved and adjusted by the democratic succession of leaders, but Saul would point out that most organizations quickly develop an old guard with calcified vested interests. (location 1264)

> Agnes worked her way through Columbia University’s Barnard College to become the first woman reporter on the New York Sun in 1907. After that she could be found studying at the Sorbonne and spending her idle hours with such as Constantin Brancusi, Darius Milhaud and Auguste Rodin. Her marriage did not slow her down, as she continued to write and study Chinese civilization at Columbia, producing her first book, Chinese Painting as Reflected in the Thought and Art of Li Lung Mien. She would later translate one of Thomas Mann’s books from the German even as she wrote a broadly republished series in the Washington Post about the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council. She was also a drunk and a wild woman. (location 1398)

> The Settlement House’s funds were of alien origin. They came from Hyde Park, the home of the University of Chicago, which was snobbish, condescending, middle-class and Protestant, or from the very rich, the bankers and business leaders in far away North Shore suburbs like Evanston and Winnetka—worlds apart from the residents of Back of the Yards. Worst of all, some of the money came from the Swift and Armour clans themselves, the hated overlords of the packing plants. These (location 1563)

> Around the time of Barry Goldwater’s run for the presidency he was contacted by the senator and the two men had at least one meeting. Goldwater or perhaps one of his people had heard of Saul and they wanted to see if there was some common ground. The conversation, he told me, (location 1839)

> The ideal organizer, Saul said, was a multiple schizophrenic, by which he meant someone able to think as others do. The ideal organizer should be able to partake of the feelings of those who pray and those who do not, of those who are oppressed and those who oppress them. (location 1892)

> going from synagogue to synagogue, splitting the membership and making off with a minority as the basis for his new organization. (location 1912)

> this kind of reorganization ignores majority rule and seeks instead to create dynamic minorities. (location 1917)

> Anyone not able to stand the tension involved would soon show the strain. (location 1918)

> He fell under the influence of Chuck Dederich, the boss of Synanon, a semicriminal drug-rehabilitation cult. Synanon’s central rite, which César made his own, was the Game, in which a person, or in this case one of the union’s staff, was put in the center of a room and surrounded by his or her colleagues who screamed epithets and accusations until the victim was reduced to human rubble. By this and similar acts of sadism the United Farm Workers’ talented and dedicated staff was one by one driven off and the organization shattered by César’s cruelty. (location 1991)

> Measured as a share of national income, company profits rose from 26% in 1993 to 31% in 2004, while workers’ wages fell from 57% to 52% (Makgetla, 2005). (location 298)

> wages and salaries are the main source of income for only about 5.9 million (57%) of the 10.3 million African households (Statistics SA, 2008c). (location 301)

> where at least one person works for a wage that is too meagre to lift them out of poverty (Meth, 2006 & 2008). The quest for more jobs is crucial, but it has to occur as part of the wider realisation of social rights. (location 303)

> Ironically, the strongest inroads against poverty have been made with interventions that were not designed for that purpose. Chapter eight reviews the origins, merits and achievements of South Africa’s social grant system, which ranks among the most impressive in the so-called ‘developing’ world. Social grants have turned out to be the single most effective anti-poverty tool deployed after 1994 (Meth, 2007). (location 312)

> Life expectancy in 2008 was 12 years lower than in 1996 and both child and maternal mortality rates have worsened since the early 1990s. This is due largely to the AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics and the bungled manner in which these were handled. Chapter nine presents a close analysis of the political economy of AIDS, an epidemic that is changing South Africa. Some of this impact is vivid, but a great deal of it is cumulative, subterranean and channelled into the lives and communities of the poor. (location 324)

> The disastrous outcomes-based education experiment was abandoned and a national health-insurance scheme was being crafted (discussed in Chapter ten). A new industrial strategy was unveiled and more plans to revive job creation were in the works (Chapters five and six). These and other potential breakthroughs are hugely important and can be augmented with many other feasible initiatives. (location 330)

> The entanglement of the party (via its investment ventures) and the fact that a substantial proportion of its office bearers are in profit-grabbing gambits favour the imperatives of the market. Almost one third of the party’s National Executive Committee also serves as directors of black economic empowerment companies. (location 351)

> The assertion of conservative values speaks to the visceral unease and insecurity, the sense of ‘things falling apart’, which formed the basis of Zuma’s triumph. (location 379)

> to ‘civilised’ Africans. Its jaundiced view of so-called ‘blanket’ or ‘uncivilised’ Africans was unabashedly conveyed in leaders’ statements and writings. As late as 1942, ANC president general Dr A B Xuma wrote to General Jan Smuts, assuring him that     we are anxious not to embarrass the government [...] We humbly and respectfully request the Prime Minister to receive a deputation from the ANC and CNETU [Council of Non-European Trade Unions] [...] to assist you toward settlement of recent strikes and prevention of future strikes.22 The ANC’s early decades were not auspicious. By 1935, the CPSA’s J B Marks (location 579)

> By 1949, the African nationalists had established their authority inside the ANC, which adopted key parts of the Youth League’s manifesto in its ‘Programme of Action’. The focus would be on organising mass struggles in urban areas, along the lines of the subsequent 1952 Defiance Campaign. But the African nationalist upsurge was already diverging into two currents. Eventually dominant within the ANC was a more moderate stream that viewed South Africa as comprising four nations (African, Indian, coloured and white), of which three were oppressed (Everatt, 2009). Meanwhile, an ultranationalist stream insisted that (location 602)

Class contradictions would become submerged in the discourse of African nationalism, which would prove ill equipped for the task of breaking South (location 610)

> replaced by a contract labour system. Between 1960 and 1982, 3.5 million people were forcibly removed by the state—one of the largest ever peacetime movements of populations. The majority of those evicted from their home and land were Africans who had lived on white-owned farms or on their own land in African districts. About 700000 more people were removed from urban areas that had been declared ‘white’ (Surplus People Project, 1983). Most were removed to patchworks of land the state had grandly categorised as ‘homelands’. Influx control was tightened, preventing Africans from being physically present in urban (‘white’) areas without the permission of state authorities. The prime function (location 765)

> wage-labour as and when required (1987:149). As late as 1980 an apartheid think tank would still propose that ‘the problem of race relations’ could be solved through ‘a system of separate political sovereignties’ joined in ‘economic cooperation’ with ‘white’ South Africa.40 The economic logic of the homelands was obvious. But political calculations would also become prominent, as apartheid planners sought to corral the post-war surge of nationalist militancy into barricaded political entities. (location 771)

> Apartheid’s harvest The post-war development strategy established an affluent welfare state for whites. White workers were guaranteed access to jobs, enjoyed rising wages and were cushioned by a wide-ranging social-security system, along with easy access to credit and loans. This increased their consumptive power, making them (and the ballooning middle class) the consumptive core of a growing economy. White trade unions won collective bargaining agreements for white workers and successively defended their (location 925)

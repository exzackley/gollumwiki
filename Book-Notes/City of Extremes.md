This focus has sometimes meant departing from the most conspicuous events and conflicts to stress seemingly innocuous actions that are more prosaic and apparently mundane, but often (location 245)

> My aim is to provide an understanding of city building in Johannesburg after apartheid as a dynamic, unresolved, and contradictory process that does not conform to a singular or linear logic. Rather than assembling interesting stories or anecdotes as a way of illustrating preconceived theories, I have sought instead to work with a number of intersecting and overlapping lines of theoretical argument to piece together a composite picture of city-building processes. This book is the product of my own particular way of seeing the sociocultural world. As such, it is invariably shaped by my historically specific ways of making sense of the everyday life of the city, with their peculiar histories and biases. Depending upon the angle of vision, our objects of inquiry have a way of moving in and out of focus. Like seeing an unfamiliar image of ourselves that startles or amuses us when we look at our reflection in a distorted mirror, we easily discover many cities in the same physical location. Just as Picasso’s multiple renderings of Velázquez’s Las Meninas produced a kaleidoscopic array of different interpretations, my reading of (location 291)

> Johannesburg does not pretend to reflect a single true or objective reality of the city. In any event, with its constant, restless evolution, Johannesburg resists all efforts at objectification, classification, and definition. Like all cities, it is an ever-changing and elusive place, impossible to capture in a single master narrative or abstract theoretical formulation. (location 298)

> I greatly appreciate the willingness of Neil Fraser, at one time the director of the Central Johannesburg Partnership, to agree to several interviews over the years. One colleague jokingly described him as a man with a “Ph.D. in optimism.” It is obvious that Neil cares deeply about the city, and I only hope that he is not egregiously disappointed that my interpretations may differ from his.

I would also like to acknowledge the assistance of Lulu Mothapo, Johnny Mpho, and Sam Maredi in Alexandra (location 420)

> what Saskia Sassen has called an “urban glamour zone” (a new hyperspace of global business and finance, with streamlined airports doubling as upscale shopping malls catering to affluent travelers, advanced telecommunications networks, state-of-the-art corporate headquarters, luxurious hotels, and an absorbing consumer culture of world-class entertainment diversions) and an “urban danger zone” (the interstitial spaces of degradation, with their broken-down infrastructure, scarce social amenities, and restricted opportunities for escape, where the vast legions of poorly paid service workers and casually employed compete with the unemployed and the unemployable, along with the marginalized and socially excluded, for survival).3 (location 505)

> Johannesburg resembles the kind of city that Pierce Lewis termed a “galactic metropolis”: an evolving spatial geography consisting of a collection of disconnected fragments that “seem to float in space; seen together, they resemble a galaxy of stars and planets, held together by mutual gravitational attraction, but with large empty areas between the clusters.”7 Much like New York and Los Angeles, Johannesburg is really a heterogeneous assemblage of mini-cities incongruously linked together to form a contrived, illusory whole. The various parts of the city are always in constant flux, and each has its own history and personality. (location 540)

> new kind of Gramscian, positional warfare revolving around the uses and meanings of urban public and private space, where fluid battle lines have been drawn not just between the rich and the poor or the haves and the have-nots, but also between the aspiring middle class and less-affluent layers of the working class, and against transient work-seekers, the poor and homeless, women and children, internal migrants, and foreign immigrants.14 (location 610)

> world. Historically speaking, the preeminence of Johannesburg as a world-famous mining center has relied on more than just technical and engineering innovation. The city has also accumulated the financial, commercial, and communications infrastructure required for deep-level mining operations to stay ahead of the field.32 (location 729)

> Like the amorphous, horizontally expansive, posturban spatial configuration that Deyan Sudjic has called “the 100 Mile City” and the architect Rem Koolhaas has celebrated as the “generic city,” Johannesburg has metamorphosed into a sprawling megalopolis, a fragmented, unsettled, and multicentered conurbation without visible boundaries or rules, lacking in scenographic clarity, semiotic unity, and physical connection.4 (location 911)

> These competing spatial logics have effectively decentered the city, giving rise to an unfinished city of fragments, separated into what John Allen has called “indifferent worlds and detached lifestyles.”7 (location 924)

> Utopian experiments with the New Urbanism (Melrose Arch), and luxurious edge cities (Sandton, Fourways, and Midrand) on the exurban fringe from geographically overextended townships and their satellite informal settlements (Soweto, Daveyton, Thokoza, Evaton, Tembisa, KwaThema, Katlehong, Duduza, Wattville, and the like), inner-city hyperghettos (Hillbrow, Joubert Park, and Berea), established urban slums (Alexandra), and new peri-urban squatter settlements (Orange Farm, Vlakfontein, Zevenfontein, and Diepsloot).8 (location 927)

> [Johannesburg] is dynamic and vigorous and brash and it has no memory. It just powers forward. It’s a pity that it has such a poor sense of its own past, but that’s Jo’burg.—David Robbins, Wasteland (location 1494)

> secular decline. (location 1968)

> What had begun as a trickle in the late 1970s turned into a flood by the 1990s, as business enterprises large and small abandoned the historic downtown core, relocating their facilities in the decentralized office and commercial nodes in the rapidly urbanizing northern suburbs. The unprecedented scale of this wholesale capital flight triggered a downward socioeconomic spiral in the central city as office vacancies inched steadily upward, rental rates fell, and property values plummeted. As was the case in most cities in South Africa and elsewhere, these structural problems were exacerbated by rising crime, poor service delivery, and deteriorating infrastructure. By the 1990s, the once thriving central city of Johannesburg had become synonymous with unregulated street trading, poor urban management, abandoned and badly maintained buildings, unauthorized squatting, overcrowding, neglected public spaces, and general disorderliness. At the same time, the exponential growth of brand-new office parks, suburban shopping malls, peri-urban industrial districts, and upscale residential accommodation on the metropolitan periphery provided alternative and convenient places for work, commerce, and recreation away from the historic core of downtown Johannesburg. Only those businesses that truly benefited from their location in the central city (or those that could not afford to move) remained. (location 1969)

> The greater Johannesburg metropolitan region has remained largely centered around, but is no longer functionally dependent upon, the historic urban core. Having succumbed to the disintegrating logic that produced the multicentrality of the postmetropolitan exopolis, the city center partially dissolved and imploded, losing its preeminent position as the primary locus of corporate decision making, technical innovation, and upscale commerce and entertainment. Despite the rhetorical commitment of municipal authorities, urban planners, and key city boosters to revitalize the inner core, the central city continued to hemorrhage businesses, jobs, and middle-income residents throughout the 1990s, leaving isolated nodes of residual development amid a shrinking tax base, decaying built environment, and an increasingly poor, transient, and largely black residential population.4 The imposing skyline of downtown Johannesburg has continued to dominate the urban landscape with its distinctive, modernist image of power, prestige, and grace. But the central city has become just one of many large concentrations of business and commercial activities in the extended metropolitan region.5 (location 1978)

> companies specializing in business and financial services, upscale leisure and entertainment (particularly glamorous cinemas, fancy hotels, upscale restaurants, and trendy nightclubs) abandoned the central city for safer, cleaner, and more easily accessible locations on the exurban fringe, particularly the concentrated commercial nodes like Parktown, Rose-bank, Hyde Park, Sandton, Sunninghill, and Midrand in the affluent northern suburbs. (location 2022)

> Fast-food outlets and take-out establishments replaced high-quality restaurants. Faced with declining revenues and the loss of their traditional white, middle-class clientele, once-fashionable five-star hotels either shut down or purposely downgraded their facilities, offering no-frills service, long-stay rates, and Spartan accommodations in response to changes in the market demand and social composition of customers.

> With the exception of such noteworthy blue-chip companies as Old Mutual, Standard Bank, ABSA, First National Bank, Anglo American, Gencor/Billiton, and several others, most well-known business enterprises—including leading firms in such specialized fields as banking, mining, construction, financial services, business law, accounting, advertising, real estate, and information technology—left the central city for more desirable locations in places like Sandton, Midrand, Parktown, Rosebank, Bedfordview, Dunkeld, Illovo, Sunninghill, and Kempton Park. Routine administrative and low-paying office jobs have remained located in the central city, in large measure because downtown sites of employment are easily accessible to the large townships, like Soweto, where many of the skilled and semiskilled workers live.

Surrounded by a high, wire-link fence, its stairwells and elevators blocked with cement to prevent squatters from getting to the upper floors, the Carlton Centre seemed to project the forbidding noir image of “a hulking wreck,” as one South African writer sarcastically put it, “Joburg’s own Titanic,” a visibly grim reminder of a once-vibrant city center.31 (location 2139)

> Like the abandonment of other landmark buildings, the hasty decision of JSE to leave downtown Johannesburg for the tranquil sanctuary of the affluent northern suburbs further undermined the once-optimistic forecasts that the transition to parliamentary democracy would stop the hemorrhage of businesses and employment from the central city. (location 2157)

> It is estimated that anywhere from 300,000 to 400,000 tourist shoppers from neighboring African countries converge on the city center each month, planning to purchase items that are cheaper in South Africa and to resell them at home for a modest profit. In 1998, these itinerant traders contributed roughly R1.4 billion to Johannesburg’s retail turnover for export purposes, and that number has increased in subsequent years. For stores targeting this expanding market, sales to these tourist shoppers generally constitute 25 percent to 30 percent of their turnover. (location 2179)

> rental rates far below those in fashionable Sandton, Rosebank, or Midrand. (location 2190)

> The inability of the built environment to accommodate the changing functions of the city contributed substantially to the physical decay of the inner city. On the one hand, there was abundant office space available for rent. On the other hand, places of residence were severely overcrowded, and hawkers flooded the sidewalks, squeezing out pedestrian traffic. During the 1990s, the demand for space in the inner city shifted away from once-prestigious corporate office complexes toward small retail outlets, residential accommodations for low-income families, and places where informal traders were able to sell their wares. (location 2211)

> The exponential expansion of informal trading has developed into one of the most spectacular expressions of the desegregation of urban space, following the repeal of the influx regulations that prevailed under apartheid. (location 2222)

> In 1994, city officials estimated that there were roughly 3,167 stalls operating within an area of 316 blocks in the city center. By 2000, the number of individual legal traders operating there was estimated to be between 40,000 and 50,000. Almost half of the hawkers are immigrants. In the main, informal trading activities are concentrated around bus terminals and taxi stands, (location 2225)

> Nostalgia is a bittersweet sentiment of loss and displacement. In the collective memory of place, it produces something akin to a double exposure, or the superimposition of two images: a longing for the unrealized promises of the past juxtaposed with the unfulfilled present.6 In the selective memory of white Johannesburg, Hillbrow—“the land of the trendiest nightclubs and never-ending parties”—has always led a charmed life. After all, “it was the place all the cool people went on New Year’s Eve.” (location 2906)

> The genesis of the once-affluent neighborhoods of Hillbrow, Berea, and Joubert Park as a high-rise residential enclave can trace its origins to the intensive building boom that engulfed the central city in the aftermath of the Second World War, leaving an entirely new layer of larger, taller, and more architecturally impressive office buildings in its wake.8 The driving force behind these spatial restructuring efforts was a grand vision of streamlined and heroic modernity in which the historic downtown business district, the main upscale shopping area that extended (location 2913)

> The haphazard march of low-density, suburban sprawl has consumed agricultural land and open spaces (greenlands) at an alarming rate. Land speculators and corporate builders have gobbled up distinctive places of natural beauty, carving them into luxurious privatopias—to borrow a word from Evan McKenzie—for affluent home buyers.19 Unfettered and irregular growth pushing outward (location 3632)

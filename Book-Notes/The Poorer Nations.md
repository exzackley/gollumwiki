> Their preoccupation is inflation—not jobs, not the livelihoods of ordinary people. (location 301)

> Second, one of the long-term trends of the capitalist system is the move by those who control capital to substitute machines for labor. (location 302)

> What we know for sure is that the time of the neoliberal state, of the governments of the possible, is now over. Even if such states remain, their legitimacy has been eroded. The time of the impossible has presented itself. That is the message of The Poorer Nations. (location 307)

> With him came the fog of American liberalism, eager to eradicate poverty without making any commitment to serious structural change. (location 346)

> From the ashes of Atlantic liberalism and the Third World project rose global neoliberalism. (location 379)

> The quadrupled price of grains through the US-dominated food grains market was also a spur, for, as the otherwise pliant Shah of Iran put it in 1973, it was the US and its North Atlantic allies that “increased the price of wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement.” Also, (location 414)

> Taking the measure of the Third World Project in February 1974, Algeria’s leader Houari Boumediène put the case for the price rise: We do not find oil too expensive. For us it is machinery, technicians, the cost of knowledge, studies and money which are too expensive. The man who goes hungry, who rides a donkey, who wants to learn to read, does not have the same preoccupation as the one who goes for a drive on Sunday, and for him the price of wheat is more important than the price (location 436)

> of asphalt. The price of wheat has quintupled. For a long time the price of iron has not moved, but by how much has the price of a tractor increased? The problem facing the world is much larger than oil alone or even raw materials: it concerns the relations between the developed countries and the others in every field. This is the heart of the question.17 (location 440)

> In 1981, the Reagan administration and the Federal Reserve turned Wall Street into its own kind of offshore facility through a provision called the International Banking Facilities.25 Wall Street became the linchpin of the new order. In its constellation would be the City of London and the Frankfurt Finanzplatz.26 The new finance market rendered archaic the textbooks on microeconomics. A few gargantuan players (such as Goldman Sachs) dominated the sell-side, creating what Peter Gowan called a “conscious cartel.”27 The North Atlantic financial cartel made a king’s ransom in the decades to come, perpetuating a process of accumulation by manipulation. (location 489)

> The World Bank was created to help manage the reconstruction of war-ravaged Europe and Japan (but not the rest of Asia, nor Africa, both also damaged by European ambitions). (location 527)

> Boumediène hastily called for the Special Session as a way to outflank a diplomatic maneuver by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Cleverly, Kissinger resorted to an old colonial trick: divide and conquer. When oil prices rose, Kissinger sought out the non-oil-producing states among the NAM who had begun to feel the pinch as oil importers. Calling these states (location 594)

> “Less Developed Countries” (LDCs), Kissinger sought to peel them away from their unity with OPEC. He also called in favors from OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia, whose role in OPEC was central. To undercut Kissinger, Boumediène called for the UN Session, to force the entire NAM bloc to go on the record in favor of the NIEO. (location 597)

> democracy. In Helsinki, the 1973 Conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe rallied around the brand “democracy” as the ideal way to show up the USSR.81 The most reliable countries, however, were not democratic in any way. The Trilateral publication pointed to Brazil (then under military rule), Mexico (then under endemic one-party rule), Iran, and Saudi Arabia (both under the rule of autocratic monarchies) as countries that should be welcomed out of Third Class into First Class. It hardly seemed to matter that the “democratic” governments in these countries wore either military or feudal uniforms. The contradiction did not bother the Trilateral, nor the G7. (location 889)

> When Kissinger and Ford called Moynihan in to brief him as the next ambassador to the UN (1975–76), Kissinger said, “that Commentary article is one of the most important articles in a long time. That is why it is essential to have him at the UN.”85 (location 918)

> it. Moynihan’s role was to crush this dynamic (his 1978 memoir of his years at the UN is called A Dangerous Place). (location 926)

> most of the countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America did not have the vast technical departments required to produce new policy agendas, or even to decipher and negotiate the major trade and other treaties. The North’s individual countries had not only large bureaucracies to offer them technical assistance, but also the OECD and the now fully neoliberal IMF, World Bank, and GATT bureaucracies. (location 2124)

> In 1982 Nyerere received the Third World Prize in Delhi. He threw down the gauntlet for the South: “It is in fact becoming increasingly clear that an unjust and exploitative international economic system is in the process of falling apart, and no arrangements for its orderly replacement are in sight. The Law of the Jungle is returning.”9 (location 2146)

> But three years later, when the South Commission returned its verdict, it left much to be desired. The vision in its document, The Challenge to the South (1990), did not provide the pathway for a new NAM politics, nor for a new politics for the South. It was an indictment of the new order and its jungle-laws, but it was not clear about what should come in its stead. (location 2150)

> The document, The Challenge of the South, though now largely forgotten, is still worth reading. (location 2162)

> These houses were called dingzihu, or “stubborn nails.” Like nails stuck in wood that cannot be easily removed, these houses sat perched on building sites, holding up construction, refusing to give way. Nyerere was a stubborn nail. As the NIEO floundered and the G7 began its inexorable march, the leaders of the NAM states wore an air of defeat. Their meetings were a shell of what they had once been, their speeches worn out— clichés from the past mixed with pleas for pragmatism and accommodation to the G7. Movements from below germinated into protests against the desiccation of agriculture, rising prices, and cutbacks in social spending. The target was now as much the IMF as it was the NAM governments. People had begun to lose patience with their postcolonial leadership. Even Nyerere, in 1984, had been forced to bind Tanzania’s exchequer to the IMF, leaving his post to a bitter struggle between his successors.11 It was not an inspirational example. (location 2167)

> It was heartbreaking for Nyerere. Nevertheless, the teacher continued to teach, to push an agenda for complete freedom and equality that was at odds with the neoliberal dispensation. In London, in 1975, at a meeting on development, Nyerere thundered: I am saying it is not right that the vast majority of the world’s population should be forced into the position of beggars, without dignity. In one world, as in one state, when I am rich because you are poor, and I am poor because you are rich, the transfer of wealth from rich to poor is a matter of right; it is an appropriate matter for charity. The objective must be the eradication of poverty, and the establishment of a minimum standard of living for all people. This involves its converse—a ceiling on wealth for individuals and nations, as well as deliberate action to transfer resources from the rich to the poor within and across national boundaries. (location 2178)

> The market economy countries of the North increase their already great strength by meeting on a regular basis and before any major international conferences; they coordinate their activities and plan their cooperation; they organize themselves in the OECD and in other ways. In their dealings with the South they accept the discipline of solidarity, and use a “divide and rule” strategy to get their way. They therefore dominate the world economy, and use its institutions to promote their own interests. (location 2203)

> Nyerere favored the second path—one that was committed to the “basic objectives” of ending destitution, hunger, ignorance, and preventable diseases. A school of thought within the UN world had come to espouse the concept of “basic needs,” and so Nyerere made this the cornerstone of his theory of development. Development in this sense requires increased consumption—therefore, necessarily increased production—of food, clothing, and shelter. It requires the public availability of clean water, of basic knowledge, and basic health service. (location 2223)

> And it means that all resources are devoted to expenditure or investment which can be shown to contribute—directly or indirectly—to the provision of these basic needs for everyone. (location 2227)

> The stubborn nail took his South Commission assignment with aplomb. To assemble his commissioners and his staff, Nyerere went on a world tour. At each stop he talked to people he respected, asking them to suggest names, to nudge him in interesting directions. (location 2234)

> Moyano would have made an excellent commissioner for the South Commission. She came from the slums, articulated an acute critique of her everyday reality, and would have proposed a unique way forward. Her total commitment to the “basic objectives,” such as her pioneering work with the Vaso de Leche (intended to get every child one glass of milk a day), aligned her completely with Nyerere. (location 2247)

> Reflecting on the decade that led to Cancún, Ramphal noted, “I think we were unwise to over-radicalize NIEO.” Cautious about a return to radicalism, he now sought change at a slow pace, at a painful pace, agreeing that there would be “great suffering in the world because of it.” (location 2260)

> Exhausted politicians who had struggled to grasp the social collapse of their societies (notably Venezuela’s Carlos Andrés Perez) gave themselves over to the concessionary framework of Ramphal, if not by instinct then certainly by programmatic defeat. (location 2278)

> Nyerere chose this wide disparity of ideology and instinct deliberately. In 1979, he reflected on the problems of disunity in the South: If we now define the economic objective too narrowly the ensuing struggle will only divide the group … We have to keep them all together. The purists will find that unpalatable. But I have always resisted “purity” during the liberation days. There are levels of purity. At the international level, purity at a certain stage of struggle can be terribly divisive. Each country must advance according to its own lights. If you require everyone to conform to a rigid political prescription, you will be weakening yourself.28 (location 2287)

> Gandhi called Singh and his Planning Commission colleagues a “bunch of jokers,” and insisted that they take on board his vision for India, with a plan “for the construction of autobahns, airfields, speedy trains, shopping malls, and entertainment centres of excellence, big housing complexes, modern hospitals and healthcare centres.” Gandhi wanted to develop India along the lines of an American suburb.38 Singh’s (location 2344)

> Singh did not share Nyerere’s capacity to hope for a socialist outcome.40 Singh was more sympathetic to Ramphal and his group. (location 2351)

> these odious debts. (location 2363)

> Emir Sader regarded the rejection of parties and governments as a serious matter because “it would severely limit the formulation of any alternatives to neoliberalism, confining such aspirations to a local or sectoral context—the NGOs’ mantra, ‘Think global, act local’; proposals for fair trade; ‘ecologically sustainable development’—while giving up any attempt to build an alternative hegemony, or any global proposals to counter and defeat world capitalism’s current neoliberal project.”39 (location 6064)

> stock-market investment takes place in companies that are based in the nation-state of the investor, and that exports make up only a quarter of the world’s economy. More dramatically, less than one-fifth of Internet activity takes place across national borders, and only 2 percent of students leave their home country for university. What we have, Ghemawat argues, is a form of semi-globalization, in which the nation-state or regional containers (location 6147)

> If governments offer more systematic agricultural support, it is often directed at the dominant classes in the countryside. These “farmers” have encouraged an agrarian populism that has allowed them to procure the bulk of the state’s resources and protect their own large holdings against the aspirations of the landless. In return, they have promised the politicians their electoral and political support, as long as the state does not open up questions of land reform.63 Over the course of the past thirty years, this sort of agrarian populism has masqueraded as “land reform.” The constitutional fight to distribute land among the population has now largely lapsed for want of political will among the ruling classes in the global South. What we have instead are sporadic attempts at land seizure, whether organized by the MST in Brazil or the war veterans in Zimbabwe—or, in a less organized way, in the regions that ring urban areas and in slumlands within them.64 (location 6226)

> Tariq Ali observes, “the partial solutions that began to be implemented after 2002 were extremely important. They improved the lives of millions of poor people by providing them with education and better healthcare. These achievements cannot be measured simply in cash terms and those who dismiss or ridicule them have, in most cases, little awareness of the social crisis that had gripped Venezuela or the reasons for the popularity of the process.”82 The (location 6413)

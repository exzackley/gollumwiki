# The State and Revolution (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)
by Vladimir Lenin

_(Last annotated on August 8, 2014)_

> He dismissed the suggestion that ‘primitive democracy’, whereby the people as a whole would participate directly in day-to-day administration, was impossible (and thus he tacitly repudiated his own views as stated in What is to be Done? in 1902). Kautsky's proposition about the inevitability of bureaucracy was ridiculed. Lenin declared that the entire life of society would be changed by the introduction of the dictatorship of the proletariat. (location 297)

> Blanqui had written explicitly about ‘the dictatorship of the proletariat’ years before Marx took up the term. (location 423)

> So it had been in 1903–5 when parallels had been drawn between Bolshevism and the ideas of the pre-Marxist Russian revolutionaries known as the narodniki. (location 430)

> Differing trends of interpretation have existed among these. One trend accepts the supposed libertarianism as a genuine reflection of Lenin's contemporary opinions; a second trend, based on a perception of the contrast with the oppressive state order after 1917 and the promises made in The State and Revolution, contends that the author was a conscious hypocrite. Still other readers have never considered that the libertarianist interpretation – quite apart from the issue of Lenin's personal motivations – holds water. For them, the book is about revolutionary violence, revolutionary dictatorship, revolutionary class struggle. (location 447)

> Throughout his life Lenin displayed both overtly libertarian and overtly authoritarian facets in his thinking. His libertarianism was more pronounced in The State and Revolution than in any of his writings either before or after 1917; but there was none the less enormous and predominant authoritarianism even in The State and Revolution. The two facets, furthermore, did not fit easily together. At no single point did Lenin declare how he would prevent the dictatorial practices which he recommended for the suppression of middle-class resistance from leaching their venom into the libertarian practices of mass political participation. Lenin's theoretical masterpiece was a hotch-potch, and there is little point in trying to reconcile the logically irreconcilable. (location 455)

> Lenin, the Marxist who had come to notice with What is to be Done? in 1902 for his almost obsessive concern about the structure and duties of his party, had no theory of parties under socialism. (location 472)

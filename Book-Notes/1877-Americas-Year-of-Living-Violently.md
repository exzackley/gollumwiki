# 1877: America's Year of Living Violently by Michael A. Bellesiles

This was one of the first books I read/listened to on a Kindle. I think my strategy in highlighting was to highlight a line in a larger paragraph or section of interest. That's why it's all fragments. 

The new thing for me in this book was the story of middle classes freaking out about the poor. The Hobo Scare came before the Red Scare. I knew about the vioence dealt by companies, police and national guard against labor. But I didn't know about how the broad middle classes got so whipped up against workers and poor people. A more current image of "Labor" is of mild middle aged guys with lunch boxes going to the factory and occasionally striking out of grumpiness. But the original image was of terrorists. 

This book confirms though that the vast majority of violence came from companies, police and soldiers, who were sometimes called out against workers. The workers tended not to be violent. They did sometimes though try to block through a sort of proto-civil disobedience

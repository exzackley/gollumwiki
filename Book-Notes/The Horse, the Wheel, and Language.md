> THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY EFFECTS OF HORSEBACK RIDING A person on foot can herd about two hundred sheep with a good herding dog. On horseback, with the same dog, that single person can herd about five hundred.35 Riding greatly increased the efficiency and therefore the scale and productivity of herding in the Eurasian grasslands. More cattle and sheep could be owned and controlled by riders than by pedestrian herders, which permitted a greater accumulation of animal wealth. Larger herds, of course, required larger pastures, and the desire for larger pastures would have caused a general renegotiation of tribal frontiers, a series of boundary conflicts. Victory in tribal warfare depended largely on forging alliances and mobilizing larger (location 3877)

> the tactics and ideology of state warfare depended on large disciplined units of anonymous soldiers who obeyed a general. These tactics, and the soldier mentality that went with them, were not applied to riders before 1000 BCE, partly because the short bows and standardized arrows that would make mounted archery truly threatening had not yet been invented. As mounted archers gained in firepower, someone on the edge of the civilized world began to organize them into armies. That seems to have occurred about 1000–900 BCE. Cavalry soon swept chariotry from the battlefield, and a new era in warfare began. But it would be grossly inappropriate to apply that later model of mounted warfare to the Eneolithic. Riding began in the region identified as the Proto-Indo-European homeland. To understand how riding affected the spread of Indo-European languages we have to pick up the thread of the archaeological narrative that ended in chapter 9. (location 3930)

> advanced in the Alps (which gave this episode its name), and winters became much colder.4 Variations in temperature in the northern hemisphere are recorded in the annual growth rings in oaks preserved in bogs in Germany and in annual ice layers in the GISP2 glacial ice core from Greenland. According to these sources, extremely cold years happened first in 4120 and 4040 BCE. They were harbingers of a 140-year-long, bitterly cold period lasting from 3960 to 3821 BCE, with temperatures colder than at any time in the previous two thousand years. Investigations led by Douglass Bailey in the lower Danube valley showed that floods occurred more frequently and erosion degraded the riverine floodplains where crops were grown. Agriculture in the lower Danube valley shifted to more cold-tolerant rye in some settlements.5 Quickly these and perhaps other stresses (location 3964)

> Alliances and trade agreements sealed by marriages could account for the increased steppe involvement in Tripolye communities during Tripolye B1, about 4400–4000 BCE. The institutions that normalized these cross-cultural relations probably included gift partnerships. In archaic Proto-Indo-European as partly preserved in Hittite, the verb root that in all other Indo-European languages meant “give” (*dō-) meant “take” and another root (pai) meant “give.” From this give-and-take equivalence and a series of other linguistic clues Emile Benveniste concluded that, during the archaic phase of Proto-Indo-European, “exchange appears as a round of gifts rather than a genuine commercial operation.”26 On the other hand, mutualism cannot explain everything, and the end of the Varna-Karanovo VI–Gumelniţa culture is one of those events it does not explain. Lawrence Keeley sparked a heated debate among archaeologists by insisting that warfare was common, deadly, and endemic among prehistoric tribal societies. Tribal frontiers might be creative places, as Frederik Barth realized, but they often witnessed pretty nasty behavior. Tribal borders commonly were venues for insults: the Sioux called the Bannock the “Filthy-Lodge People”; the Eskimo called the Ingalik “Nit-heads”; the Hopi called the Navaho “Bastards”; the Algonkian called the Mohawk “Maneaters”; the Shuar called the Huarani “Savages”; and the simple but eloquent “Enemies” is a very common meaning for names given by neighboring tribes. Because tribal frontiers displayed things people needed just beyond the limits of their own society, the temptation to take them by force was strong. It was doubly strong when those things had legs, like cattle.27 (location 4144)

> Cattle raiding was encouraged by Indo-European beliefs and rituals. The myth of Trito, the warrior, rationalized cattle theft as the recovery of cattle that the gods had intended for the people who sacrificed properly. Proto-Indo-European initiation rituals included a requirement that boys initiated into manhood had to go out and become like a band of dogs or wolves—to raid their enemies.28 Proto-Indo-European also had a word for bride-price, *ŭedmo-.29 Cattle, sheep, and probably horses would have been used to pay bride-prices, since they generally are valued higher than other currencies for bride-price payments in pastoral societies without formal money.30 Already in the preceding centuries domesticated animals had become the proper gifts for gods at funerals (e.g., at Khvalynsk). A relatively small elite already competed across very large regions, adopting the same symbols of status—maces with polished stone heads, boar’s tusk plaques, copper rings and pendants, shell disc beads, and bird-bone tubes. When bride-prices escalated as one aspect of this competition, the result would be increased cattle raiding by unmarried men. Combined with the justification provided by the Trito myth and the institution of male-initiation-group raiding, rising bride-prices calculated in animals would have made cross-border raiding almost inevitable.

> archbishop from 816 to 841, he saw a great deal of this kind of behavior and did not approve. He was impatient with the kind of populist mixture of Christianity, paganism, and superstition that made up the religion of most people, and he was determined to do something about it. His treatise Concerning Hailstorms and Thunder confronted some of these popular beliefs head-on, characterizing them as foolishness, craziness, and stupidity. Agobard focused particularly on weather-makers or storm-makers, people who thought they could manipulate the weather through their incantations and magic. He confessed that even in his own archdiocese, “almost everyone . . . thinks that hail and thunder result from human decision. For as soon as they hear thunder and lightning they say, ‘The air is raised up.’ When asked how this happens, some reply with uncertainty, disturbed by their consciences, others confidently, as is typical of the ignorant, that the wind has been raised up by the incantations of men called ‘tempest-raisers,’ and therefore it is called a ‘raised gale.’”1 On the day in question, he probably had heard about the captured travelers and came immediately to the village to argue on the spot with the common folk who made such claims. This doesn’t mean that Agobard was a skeptical, (location 268)

> This was a parochial, self-referential world in which the papacy increasingly became the plaything of local powerbrokers. It was symptomatic of the loss of any notion of a broader state authority and a retreat into the priority of the local. (location 786)

> Who lived in the city? Obviously, many residents were clerics and their families who either worked in the papal bureaucracy or served the almost two hundred churches in Rome. From about the sixth century onward, a man entered the ranks of the clergy through tonsure, a ceremonial cutting off of a portion of hair on the crown of the head by the bishop, symbolizing his leaving the world behind and making a commitment to the service of the church. Not all tonsured clergy went on to be ordained bishops, priests, and deacons. Some clerics were installed as subdeacons or in one of the four minor orders of porter, lector, exorcist, and acolyte, ranks that had appeared in the fourth century. Since the papacy was central to both the civil and ecclesiastical administration of Rome, it’s reasonable to say that many Romans were employed by or depended on the church. Young clerics generally entered the papal service as cubicularii, chamberlains or personal attendants of the pope. These were usually male youths from noble families, many of them already in minor orders, who lived in the papal household while gaining an education. Poorer boys could prepare for clerical careers through the schola cantorum (singing school), which trained young men for liturgical ceremonies. Others were educated in local monasteries. All these youths received a good education in grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, music, physics, arithmetic, morals, theology, and liturgy. The cubicularii illustrate the fact that, despite the pervasive presence of married clergy, the clerical world had for centuries been a somewhat closed milieu and that young men were initiated into this somewhat homoerotic world of all-male communities. Entry into the clerical state or ordination to the priesthood, deaconate, and minor orders didn’t require celibacy. Nevertheless, from the late fourth century onward in the Western Church, there was pressure from rigorist, strict, and austere Christians, often finding expression in local church councils and synods, to prevent priests, once ordained, from marrying or from remarrying if a spouse died. However, in reality the vast majority of men in major and minor orders continued to live married or de facto lives with their female partners; this included many of the Roman clergy. A number of popes in the first millennium were married, including Saint Peter. Ratherius of Verona commented that priests often arranged marriages for their daughters to other priests. He commented that if he expelled all priests who lived with women in his diocese or who married after ordination, there would be none left. As Gary Macy comments, “Not all bishops, priests and deacons separated from their wives or undertook a life of continence. . . . Clergy continued to marry and live normal, active married lives well into the twelfth century.”8 (location 832)

> By the end of the ninth century, the Carolingian empire had collapsed and disintegrated. Europe was left with a power vacuum that allowed opportunists to seize power in local regions. Italy was a prime example of this process: upstart rulers in Tuscany, Spoleto, Friuli (northeast Italy), and Ivrea (northwest Italy) swiftly seized the moment. These duchies were dominated by families who were originally non-Italian. Friuli was ruled by Berengar I (888–924), whose family came from the lower Rhine. Tuscany emerged in the ninth century to buttress the Mediterranean coast against the Saracens, and the ruling family originated in Bavaria. As we saw, Guido I (842–ca. 860), an ambitious upstart from eastern France, made himself duke of Spoleto. Alberico I, another Frankish adventurer, later seized power in the tiny enclave of Camerino. He then murdered Guido IV of Spoleto in 896 and united Camerino with Spoleto. Ivrea was ruled by Ansgario, who came from the same region in France as Guido I. Hugo was another foreigner, from Provence. These upstarts constantly vied with each other to be king of Italy and emperor, meaningless as these titles had become. Liutprand cynically comments that “the Italians always prefer to have two kings, so that they may keep one in check by threatening him with the other.”12 (location 1404)

> typical of the rest of early-tenth-century Europe, where local issues far outweighed in importance broader preoccupations with the state and government. This emphasis on the parochial caused the Romans to continue to have difficult relationships with Otto and his successors, as we will explore later. (location 1700)

> Rome and more broadly northern and central Italy vividly illustrate the breakdown of any form of central government and the constant instability caused by a series of local upstarts seizing power for themselves, which was typical of the first part of the tenth century. The frustration experienced by Otto I in Italy originated in the clash between Italian and specifically Roman localism and the loss of any coherent conception of sovereignty over against the German vision of a larger integrated polity with a coherent government and clear lines of state authority. This is the core issue in the tenth century: how to recover some overall sense of central authority and to turn geographical expressions like “Germany,” “France,” and “Italy” into real states. Led by the Saxon monarchs, the Germans were the first to achieve this. What these last two chapters have also illustrated is how difficult it was going to be to reform the papacy, with its conflation of the spiritual government of the church and the political government of the papal state.

> Belgian historian Henri Pirenne argues that the Arab conquests cut Europe off from the Mediterranean world and stunted its economic growth.26 What’s more important was that Islamic control of the Mediterranean isolated Latin Christianity, confined it to Europe, and hastened its separation from the Eastern Church. This division was to become de facto complete in the eleventh century. (location 1939)

> One of the most terrifying aspects of the Saracen raids was their practice of seizing prisoners to sell into slavery. The Annals of Saint-Bertin records a Saracen attack in 838 on Marseilles in which they “carried off all the nuns, of whom there was a large number living there, as well as all the males, both clergy and laymen, laid waste to the town and took away with them en masse the treasures of Christ’s churches.”34 They then sold these nuns and priests into slavery. Besides those they captured from mainland Europe, the main sources of slaves for the Islamic world were sub-Saharan Africa, Slavs from Eastern Europe, Turks from Central Asia, and, to a lesser extent, Anglo-Saxons, whom they valued for their fair skin. The word “slave” is actually derived from “Slav” rather than from the Latin servus, meaning “servant.” Slavery was not common in Western Europe at the time; there were only a small number of slaves to be found there. The great majority was in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. The Catholic Church disapproved of slavery, but Welsh and Irish slaves, many still adolescents, who had been captured by the Vikings, were nonetheless sold through ports like Hull, Bristol, Venice, and Barcelona to meet demand in the Islamic world. Jews were often blamed for maintaining the slave trade by being the middlemen. But Christians and, of course, Muslims were also involved. In the west Verdun, Lyons and Venice were the main slave-trading centers, with Córdoba and Cairo the principal markets in the Muslim world. Many male slaves destined for domestic service or the management of harems were castrated with the removal of their testes or penis, extremely painful operations done without painkillers.

> Jacques Ellul points (location 2015)

> Ellul argues that early Christianity was always suspicious of war given the teaching of Jesus that enemies must be forgiven and loved. But the Christians learned from the Muslims, and by the eleventh century Christianity was infected with notions of crusades and holy wars. Ellul also argues that Islam created a paramountcy of law over love in which law became the preeminent value. The jurist replaced the theologian. This flowed into a preoccupation with canon law and its subsequent dominance in Catholicism. (location 2017)

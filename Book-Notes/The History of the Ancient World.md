> The tax burden had become so unbearable that parents were forced to sell their children into slavery in order to pay their debts.5 (location 1827)

> Urukagina got rid of most of the tax collectors and lowered the taxes. He cancelled fees for basic services. He forbade officials and priests to seize anyone’s land or possessions in payment of debt, and offered amnesty to the debtors. He slashed Lagash’s bureaucracy, which was bloated with pork-barrel positions (these included the head boatman, the inspector of fishing, and the “supervisor of the store of the cereals”). He also, apparently, took authority away from the priests by dividing religious and secular functions, thus preventing exactly the kind of authority that had allowed Mesilim to set up his stele by the authority of the god Sataran: “Everywhere from border to border,” his chronicler tells us, “no one spoke further of priest-judges…. The priest no longer invaded the garden of the humble man.”7 (location 1830)

> “He established amagi. The widow and the orphan were no longer at the mercy of the powerful: it was for them that Urukagina made his covenant with Ningirsu.”8 (location 1838)

> Amagi: the cuneiform sign seems to stand for freedom from fear, the confidence that the life of Lagash’s citizens can be governed by a certain and unchanging code and not by the whims of the powerful. (location 1840)

> His curtailment of priestly abuses made him unpopular with the religious establishment. (location 1847)

> his actions on behalf of the poor made him unpopular with the rich men of his own city. (location 1848)

> These very men, the lugals (“great householders”) of Lagash, had been severely criticized in Urukagina’s inscriptions for abusing their poorer neighbors.9 (location 1850)

> the priests not only of Lagash, but also of Nippur, the sacred city of Enlil, were cooperating with the conqueror.11 (location 1858)

> An account written by a scribe convinced of Urukagina’s righteousness, promises that the good king will be avenged: “Because the Ummaite destroyed the bricks of Lagash,” the scribe warns, “he committed a sin against Ningirsu; Ningirsu will cut off the hands lifted against him.” (location 1861)

> probably crippled by a rift in their cities. Sumerian cities just before the conquest were suffering from an increased gap between elite leadership and the poor laborers. (location 1949)

> Sargon’s relatively easy conquest of the area (not to mention his constant carping on his own non-aristocratic background) may reveal a successful appeal to the downtrodden members of Sumerian society to come over to his side.8 (location 1952)

> Sargon did what no Sumerian king had yet done successfully; he turned a loose coalition of cities into an empire.36 (location 1955)

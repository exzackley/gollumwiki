# A Nation of Counterfeiters: Capitalists, Con Men, and the Making of the United States

> Many merchants and financial writers referred to counterfeiters as “bankers” or “capitalists,” a tacit acknowledgment that these criminals conducted their affairs with a comparable level of sophistication. (location 219)

> “So systematic, indeed, has this nefarious traffic become of late,” complained the editors of the National Police Gazette in 1849, “that the great dealers execute orders for the town and country with the same method and regularity, as manufacturers in fair branches of trade.”14 (location 222)

> As Hezekiah Niles observed, if “the Daemon of Avarice [was] the author of modern banking,” so too was “banking the fountain of counterfeiting.” (location 257)

> “ ‘Make money, honestly, if you can, but at all events, make money,’ seems to be the rule of the present day; for there is scarcely a section of the country to which we turn where we will not see some people industriously making money.”17 (location 259)

> Those questions boiled down to a simple choice. Should the nation control the currency, or should the right to print and mint money belong to the very capitalists who wanted it most? Those questions originated in the eighteenth century, (location 284)

> At times, the country seemed less a coherent whole than a collection of self-interested strivers united only in their restless ambition, their hatred of monopoly, and their love of lucre. (location 288)

> Like the promises to pay that adorned bank notes, there was little substance to the nation’s claims of sovereignty over the individual states. (location 290)

> Whether the issue was the War of 1812, tariffs on manufactured goods, or most important, the looming question of slavery, the nation was beset from threats to its continued existence from within and without, and the idea of a permanent, enduring union existed more on paper than in practice. This was especially true when it came to monetary matters, over which the federal government exercised next to no control for much of this period. (location 293)

> Burroughs thus came to symbolize not only the conflation of capitalism and counterfeiting, but also the limits of American economic and political authority. (location 383)

> In the absence of sufficient specie, the need for a circulating medium remained. Book credits and barter could only go so far in facilitating economic exchange. Particularly in the growing seaport cities, merchants needed something a bit more fungible than a cow, a bolt of cloth, or a peck of grain when they paid for goods or settled debts. Colonial governments consequently sanctioned a host of commodity monies beginning in the early seventeenth century. Tobacco, iron nails, and animal pelts all served as crude currencies, with a legislative fiat setting up equivalence between the commodity and a specified number of shillings or pennies. Though such makeshift monies circulated, they proved an unreliable store or measure of value, because their prices fluctuated far more than precious metals did. Wampum, strings of clam shell beads that could be traded with the Indians for pelts, proved a better substitute for specie. First adopted by the Dutch and then by the English, wampum nonetheless fell victim to overproduction, counterfeiting, and the growing scarcity of beaver. One by one, the colonies revoked its legal tender status by the end of the seventeenth century.9 (location 404)

> There was in all of this a hint of the magical, or at the very least, magic by other means. In fact, some of the very first proposals for issuing paper currency originated with a coterie of Puritan intellectuals who had a double obsession with money and magic. Samuel Hartlib, a scientist active in the founding of the Royal Society, was the center of this group. He wrote on economic matters and believed that an increase in money would lead to an increase in economic activity. “The more there is of money in any Nation, the quicker also must all those wayes be, wherein money is ordinarily imployed.” Hartlib and the circle of thinkers around him—including George Starkey and John Winthrop Jr. in Massachusetts—pursued extensive studies in alchemy in the hopes of increasing the stock of money. While eventually frustrated in their ambitions, these men eventually settled on paper money as a roundabout means of achieving the alchemical effect. A 1652 pamphlet on bank currency authored by a member of the Hartlib circle made the connection explicit, likening such money to “the Elixir or Philosopher’s Stone.”12 (location 438)

> Paul Dudley accused the proponents of paper money of creating value out of thin air. “If this be not the Philosopher’s Stone,” he charged, “there is no such thing in the world.” The twinning of magic and money achieved an even more enduring and infamous association the following year, when the new re-gent of France, Philippe d’Orléans, faced with a dire financial crisis, summoned a number of alchemists to his court in the hopes they could manufacture artificial gold. According to legend, he dismissed them upon the arrival of a Scottish gambler named John Law, who proposed a more modern solution to his woes: the creation of a bank that would issue paper money backed by lands owned by the state. Law superintended the creation of two note-issuing institutions whose paper promises were ultimately backed by the promised discovery of gold in America’s Mississippi River Valley. Eventually, confidence in Law and his creations collapsed and the currency ceased to circulate.13 (location 448)

> For every critic like Paul Dudley, there was someone like John Wise, who wrote in support of a “land bank” the year after Law’s scheme collapsed. (location 457)

> “Those who are Lovers of Trade, and delight to see Manufactures encouraged, will be for having a large Addition to our Currency,” Franklin wrote. “For they very well know, that People will have little Heart to advance Money in Trade, when what they can get is scarce sufficient to purchase Necessaries.” Like (location 465)

> as Franklin explained to Parliament in 1767, much of the colonies’ ill will was a response to “the prohibition of making paper money among themselves.”17 Even if the imperial authorities had succeeded in throttling the colonies’ impulse to “make money,” enterprising criminals would have supplied a circulating medium. Initially, counterfeiters restricted themselves to imitating the various Spanish and English coins in circulation, (location 494)

> If Burroughs and Lysander failed in their attempts to increase the quantity of cash, so did Daniel Shays, the Massachusetts farmer who led an insurrection to bring some relief to the specie-starved farmers. The revolt failed, but focused attention on political reform, particularly among the economic and social elite who met in 1787 to discuss changes to the Articles of Confederation. After considerable debate, they jettisoned the Articles altogether and instead drafted a blueprint for a much stronger central government: the Constitution. That document, which was debated and sent to the colonies for ratification just before Burroughs emerged from prison in 1788, reflected the hard-money bias of the individuals who framed it. It granted to Congress the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, mint coin, and regulate the money supply. Significantly, it was forbidden for individual states to “emit Bills of Credit [or] make anything but Gold or Silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” This was another way of saying, however ambiguously, that paper money should not have a place in the nation’s circulating medium.29 (location 599)

> securities. “She always had an itch for speculation,” Burroughs was made to say. “It is owing to her that I am now a ruined man. I told her this banking was a ‘hazardous business.’ ”44 (location 743)

> betrayed. “I am one of those who promised gold, not paper,” he cried from the floor of Congress. “I promised the currency of the constitution, not the currency of corporations. I did not join in putting down the Bank of the United States, to put up a wilderness of local banks.” (location 2159)

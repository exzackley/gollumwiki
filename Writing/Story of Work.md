The Story of Work -- a response to The Story of Stuff

Thoughtful, concerned environmentalists and social activists have decided that the problem with the world today is TOO MUCH STUFF. A lot of us do have way too much stuff. I sat next to Annie Leonard at conference once, the maker of the Story of Stuff video, and was a little surprised to see that she had an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. So do I.

One billion people, however, do not even have a toilet.

Two billion people, however, don't even have a decent roof over their heads.

Three billion people don't have access to modern drugs or medical equippment.

Maybe my problem, and Annie Leonard's problem is too much stuff. But is that really the main problem for the world?

We both really like our gadgets -- and for good reasons. They let us connect with friends, colleagues and a huge chunk of humanity in a way we couldn't even imagine would be possible a short time ago.

Other stuff I'm sure we both enjoy: indoor plumbing, hot water, central heating and airconditioning, kitchen stoves, bicycles, automobiles, airplanes, sneakers, pencils and pens.

I don't think Annie is suggesting that we go without that kind of stuff. And yet the vast majority of the people in the world still lack many of those things that we take for granted.

Therefore -- how can the problem of the world be TOO MUCH STUFF?

U.S. and European environmentalists have been talking like this for a long time. And most of them are not standing in the front of the line to give away all their stuff.

There is something really mean about this. We who already have all this good stuff seem to want to keep all of OUR stuff while stopping everyone else from getting their hands on the same STUFF.

But Annie Leonard is right about one thing: The way we're producing all this stuff today is unsustainable. We're filling the atmosphere with gasses that apparently are heating up the planet. We're filling the oceans with toxins and junk. We're filling landfills and even whole countries with rediculous quanities of poisoned trash.

And even with all this hyperactive production of SO MUCH STUFF -- billions of people are still going with the basics.

What is going on? What is the solution?

These two problems -- TOO MUCH STUFF for a few and TOO LITTLE STUFF for the rest -- are actually two sides of the same problem, and they both have the same solution.

But to get to that solution, we need a different story. It's The Story of Work. The Story of Work holds the key to solving both the problem of a few of us wrecking the planet with TOO MUCH STUFF and the problem of so many not even having the basic stuff they need to stay alive.

Humans have always lived through work. In the beginning, that meant walking around and gathering food and occasionally hunting. Humans spread all over the world living by that kind of work.

Our environmental problems did not start with the iPhone. In fact, hunter gathers devastated many of the environments they entered long before the industrial revolution -- and even before agriculture. The technology of fire and spears were enough to cause mass extinctions and deforestations over huge areas of the globe.

And then we invented a new kind of work that was even more devastating: farming. Early farming was incredibly wasteful. Whereas hunter gatherers were able to come into balance with an ecosystem, sometimes after an initially painful shock, early farmers quickly depleted the land and had to keep moving on. Early farmers were the first true nomads, as hunter gatherers were able to live inside of a given territory forever once they had adapted to it.

Eventually, farming became sustainable. But it wasn't because farmers suddenly decided to GROW LESS STUFF. They improved their technology. They learned about letting land lie fallow, and about fertilizer. They learned how different types of plants enriched the land for each other. They learned about irrigation. They modified crops through selective breeding.

But right about the time that farming because a sustainable way of life, we invented a new way of making a living: Industry.

Now, huge factories rose up from the land. Farmers found that they were being thrown off land they had farmed for millennia to make room for the sheep to feed the first mechanized industry: textiles. There was a new place for them: the factories that spun wool into thread and wove thread into cloth.























In Annie Leonard's story, STUFF seems to magically appear from cartoon factories. The workers in those factories are seen as victims who can be liberated if only we stop buying the things they make.

Let's just think that through a little bit? Were workers forced into those factories at gun point? No, they went there to make a living by working. They went there because the work offered in those factories was better for them than they work they were able to find elsewhere.

Yes, in most factories, work is pretty terrible. But what does it say that billions of people are trying to get that work? It says the alternative for them is even worse.

What do they get in those factories that they can't get elsewhere? They get access to the tools and equipment with which to make things that other people value -- iPhones for example.

Because iPhones are highly-valued, workers who make them have a claim on some of that value. To get the workers to show up every day and do good work, we consumers of iPhones must pay them something. Even though it's executed invisibly to us through a long chain of money transactions, iPhone consumers are making a trade with the workers who make iPhones. The workers put value into the iPhones, and they get in return tokens of value that they will exchange for food, housing, education and even an iPhone of their own -- or more likely a cheaper knock off!

Annie Leonard says the solution to worlds' biggest problem is for us to stop buying so many iPhones. But what happens to the workers in the factories then? How will they make a living? If their jobs in the factories disappear, what kind of sacrifices will they need to make to get by? Also, what's to say that in the course of trying to making a living, they won't do even more harm to the planet?

I guess we of TOO MUCH STUFF imagine the workers leaving their factories, and going back to some idyllic countryside life as farmers. Except that when billions of people farm crowded land, it turns out to be just as much of an ecological disaster as when they make STUFF in factories.

After all, one of the big reasons so many people flock to cities looking for work in factories is that they

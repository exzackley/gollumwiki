Beyond Outrage: Expanded Edition: What has gone wrong with our economy and our democracy, and how to fix it (Vintage) by Robert B. Reich

So! In case you don't remember, or weren't born yet, Robert Reich first made it big on the national stage in the 1980's with his book the Work of Nations -- where he said we should swap manufacturing jobs for 'symbolic analysis' jobs because manufacturing jobs are easy to ship overseas (and they're hard) while knowledge jobs can never be off-shored.

That was before the Internet made knowledge jobs even easier to send away than manufacturing jobs. The week that Whatsapp -- the creator of a whopping 55 jobs -- sold to Facebook for $19 billion, Reich argued now that these knowledge jobs were the whole problem with the new American economy. Nowhere in his column did he say, "I actually argued for this kind of economy and got it wrong." That really annoyed me, and I wondered what his new proposed solutions were.

I read his latest book, which thankfully was a short read. First, he lays out what is wrong with our current economy. Then he offers "solutions." I'll warn you now, the solutions are insanely weak stuff. However, it's right in line with what the vast majority of progressives agree with -- which is no surprising, considering that Reich has been a progressive thought leader for a LONG time.

OK, first off: the American worker and Salaryman are getting screwed. And it's all Mitt Romney's fault. (The book was written during the 2012 election.)

> The presidential candidate Mitt Romney said free enterprise is on trial. He’s right, but it’s not on trial in the way he assumed. The attack on it is not coming from the left. It’s coming from the grass roots of America—right, left, and center. And it’s been triggered by an overwhelming consensus that Wall Street, big corporations, and the very wealthy have rigged it to their benefit. Increasingly, the rewards have gone to the top, while the risks have been borne by middle- and lower-income people. At the same time, the very wealthy are getting a greater share of total income than they did at any point in the last eighty years. Their tax rates are lower than they’ve been in a generation. Republicans want us to believe that the central issue is the size of government, but the real issue is whom government is for. Public institutions are deteriorating. We’re saddled by the most anemic recovery from the worst economy since World War II, while the basic bargain linking pay to productivity continues to come apart.

It's interesting: throughout the book, you can feel Riech wrestling with an awareness that the vast majority of working class and lower middle class people are totally opposed to his way of looking at the economy. Above, he tries to say that the grass roots of the American right is "putting free enterprise on trial," but as he says several times later in the book, he knows that's not true.

In *every single* conversation with a right winger or libertarian -- they all agree that corporations and the super rich are fleecing the country. But they don't blame them, they blame the politicians who are letting them do it. Not just letting them do it, but doing it for them.

Reich tells the story of that fleecing, and agrees that politicians are the enablers, but lays the blame on the rich and CEOs. To me, this split is SOOO interesting. I want to go get a PHD in History purely to understand this split between today's American right and left.

I think basically the left represents the original first-gen Puritan settlers who did things like throw you in the stocks if you sold something above the "just price" and who generally felt a ton of guilt about making money (even as they made it hand over fist) and shamed those who didn't go out of their way to show that they were helping the community and being fair in their business dealings. And the right represents the next generation of some Puritans and Scottish and other non-Puritan immigrants who started building iron works and tiny textile mills -- and who had to flee to Maine or go back to England to win the freedom to do it.

I don't know... I need to go get the PHD. But when I recently read a few books about early colonial society -- like [[Puritans and Adventurers]] and [[The Barbarous Years]] -- I felt I could see the same personality types that divide U.S. poltics today.

> In the late 1980s, I noticed a troubling trend. A larger and larger share of the nation’s income and wealth was going to the very top—not just the top 1 percent, but the top of the top 1 percent—while other Americans were dividing up a shrinking share. I wrote up my findings, and my tentative explanation for this trend, in a book called The Work of Nations. Bill Clinton read the book, and after he was elected president, he asked me to be his secretary of labor. He told me he was committed to reversing the trend, and he called for more investment in education, training, infrastructure, and health care in order to make the bottom half of our population more productive. Clinton and his administration worked hard, but we were never able to implement his full agenda. The economic recovery of the middle and late 1990s was strong enough to generate twenty-two million new jobs and raise almost everyone’s wages, but it did not reverse the long-term trend. The share of total income and wealth claimed by the top continued to grow, as did the political clout that accompanies such concentration. Most Americans remained unaware.

The __Work of Nations__ is the book where Reich says we need to get rid of the dirty jobs and move up the economic food chain to "knowledge jobs." Unfortunately, it really meant moving down the food chain to fast food jobs.

It's kinda funny how he says Clinton read his book and hired him. Actually they were Rhodes scholars together.

It's really funny too how he gives Clinton policies credit for creating those jobs. The jobs were created by a bubble that Clinton not-really-intentionally blew up by balancing the budget (against Reich's bitter opposition) to appease the bond traders.

> Score a big one for the Occupiers. Regardless of whether you sympathize with the so-called Occupier movement that began spreading across America in the fall of 2011, or whether you believe it will become a growing political force in America, it has had a profound effect on the national conversation.

Occupy was happening at the time that he wrote this. He keeps referring to it as a potential sea change in public opinion. It was soooo small. CNN made it seem so big.

> And many blame Republicans for stacking the deck in favor of the rich. In that New York Times/CBS News poll, 69 percent of respondents said Republican policies favor the rich (28 percent said the same of President Obama’s policies).

It's just that 50% of the 69% believed that was a good thing. As they chanted at one of the Glenn Beck stadium rallies I went to, "No one ever worked for a poor man."

Now here are a bunch of good factoids about clepto-CEOs to use sometime:

> The ratio of corporate profits to wages is higher than it’s been since before the Great Depression. The chairman of Merck took home $17.9 million in 2010, as Merck laid off sixteen thousand workers and announced layoffs of twenty-eight thousand more. The CEO of Bank of America raked in $10 million, while the bank announced it was firing thirty thousand employees.

> Citigroup’s stock fell 44 percent in 2011, but its CEO, Vikram Pandit, got at least $5.45 million on top of a retention bonus of $16.7 million. The stock of JPMorgan Chase fell 20 percent, but its CEO, Jamie Dimon, was awarded a package worth $22.9 million.

> This sort of hedging helped the head of AIG, Hank Greenberg, collect $250 million in 2008, when AIG collapsed. Other CEOs are guaranteed huge compensation regardless of how their companies do. Robert Iger’s arrangement as head of the Disney Company netted him $52.8 million in 2011 and guarantees him at least $30 million a year more through 2015—regardless of company performance. The swankiest golf courses of America are festooned with former CEOs who have almost sunk their companies but been handsomely rewarded. Gilbert Amelio headed Apple for a disastrous seventeen months while the firm lost nearly $2 billion, but he walked away with $9.2 million anyway. William D. McGuire was forced to resign as CEO of UnitedHealth over a stock-options scandal but left with a pay package worth $286 million.

> Thomas E. Freston lasted just nine months as CEO of Viacom before being terminated with an exit package of $ 101 million. Scott Thompson lasted only four months as CEO of Yahoo!, but that was long enough for him to pocket $ 7 million. His predecessor, Carol Bartz, lasted twenty months and left with an exit package of $ 10.4 million. You can push your company to the brink and still make a fortune. Robert Rossiter, the former CEO of Lear, landed his company in bankruptcy, which wiped out his shareholders along with twenty thousand jobs, but he walked away from the wreckage with a $ 5.4 million bonus. In early 2012, The Wall Street Journal looked into the pay of executives at twenty-one of the largest companies that had recently gone through bankruptcy. The median compensation of those CEOs was $ 8.7 million— not much less than the $ 9.1 million median compensation of all CEOs of big companies. The reason CEOs get giant pay packages for lousy performance is that they stack their boards of directors’ compensation committees with cronies who make sure they do.

> Even if you commit fraud, your personal financial risk is minimal. Starting in 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed twenty-five cases against mortgage originators and securities firms. A few are still being litigated, but most have been settled. They generated almost $2 billion in penalties and other forms of monetary relief, according to the SEC. But almost none of this money came out of the pockets of CEOs or other company officials; it came out of the companies—or, more accurately, their shareholders. In the one instance in which company executives appear to have been penalized directly—a case brought against three former top officials of New Century Financial, a brazenly fraudulent lender that subsequently collapsed—the penalties were tiny compared with how much the executives pocketed. New Century’s CEO had to disgorge $542,000 of his ill-gotten gains, but he took home more than $2.9 million in “incentive” pay in the two years before the company tanked.

Good stat about pensions disappearing:

> Most people also face the increasing risk of not having enough to retire on. Three decades ago more than 80 percent of large and medium-sized firms gave their workers “defined benefit” pensions that guaranteed a fixed amount of money every month after they retired. Now it’s fewer than 10 percent.

Yes, but most believe the government gave it to them.

> Homeowners couldn't use bankruptcy to reorganize their mortgage loans, because the banks have engineered the bankruptcy laws to prohibit this.

The majority of the country totally rejects this line of thinking. The Congress passed the law. I remember -- a good friend was working right in Harry Reid's office. They just passed it. He quit over it. He was just disgusted -- because they just passed it. No banks had a gun to their head. It is incredibly twisted logic that lets you say, "$5000 campaign contributions all banks to 'engineer new bankruptcy laws'." I understand the money is a little more complex than that. But I spent 6 years in DC. I was having breakfast with Senators. I saw enough to know that it's not money that's swaying their votes on important issues. The problem is that they are close friends -- or spouses, or parents, or children -- of the people who run the banks, the insurance companies, the oil companies. ALL of their inputs are telling them that what's good for business is good for America.

It doesn't matter that America's business is not fleecing America. The maxim still holds for them.

> Young people can’t use bankruptcy to reorganize their student loans either, because the banks have barred it. But big businesses now routinely use bankruptcy to renege on contracts with their workers. American Airlines entered bankruptcy in 2012 and promptly announced plans to fire thirteen thousand workers— 16 percent of its workforce— while cutting back the health benefits of current employees. It had intended to terminate its underfunded pension plans, threatening the largest pension default in U.S. history— much of whose cost would be borne by taxpayers if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation took them over. (The airline subsequently backed down, freezing but not terminating the pensions.) By 2012, long after the economic collapse, average consumers and small businesses were still hurting, but corporations large enough to finance fleets of Washington lobbyists were raking it in. Big agribusiness continues to claim hundreds of billions of dollars in price supports and ethanol subsidies, paid for by American consumers and taxpayers. Big Pharma gets extended patent protection that drives up everyone’s drug prices, plus the protection of a federal law making it a crime for consumers to buy the same drugs at lower prices from Canada. Big oil gets its own federal tax subsidy, paid for by taxpayers.

Good factoid -- but why doesn't Reich have any footnotes!!? It makes this book useless for the hackjob I will someday write!

Here and there he comes out and says that profit is the wrong way to organize an economy. But it's so passive aggressive that it's funny. He is so publicly committed to the capitalist line. What he really wants is an economy planned -- no not by socialists -- by liberal philosopher kings a la Croly, Wells, Bellamy and just about every liberal from 1850 to 1940. Me and Reich oughta get together. We both come from lost traditions. But his was wrong. OK, so was mine... that's why we'd have a cool conversation. Next time I bump into him (it's happened -- physically -- twice. Once at the movies, once in a hotel in Laguna Beach).

And did you know that Republicans are soft on Tsunamis!

“Big government” isn’t the problem. The problem is the big money that’s taking over government. Government is doing fewer of the things most of us want it to do—providing good public schools and affordable access to college, improving our roads and bridges and water systems, maintaining safety nets to catch people who fall, and protecting the public from dangers—and more of the things big corporations, Wall Street, and wealthy plutocrats want it to do.

OK -- he never actually says that school funding has been seriously cut, but he keeps insinuating it. In fact, school funding is about double what it was in the 1970's.

> In May 2012, Politico revealed that Republican super PACs and other outside groups shaped by a network of conservatives—led by Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and Tom Donohue—planned to spend about $1 billion on the 2012 election for the White House and control of Congress. Koch-related organizations also planned to spend $400 million ahead of the 2012 elections, including county-by-county operations in key states. All this outside spending would be in addition to traditional party fund-raising: the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee intended to raise $800 million. If all of them—the outside groups and the Republican campaigns—hit their targets, they would outspend Democrats two to one. (President Obama’s super PAC hoped to spend $100 million.

Wow all that money! How's Obama win? I watched about a billion dollars be spent in 2004. The deafening flushing sound is still ringing in my ears.

Sometimes I just grab representative quotes -- like this:

He should hammer more on this. The path to America's heart is through it's payroll tax anger.

> America. Middle- and lower-income Americans are shelling out larger portions of their sinking incomes in payroll taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes than they did thirty years ago. The Social Security payroll tax continues to climb as a share of total government tax revenues. Yet the payroll tax is regressive, applying only to yearly income under $110,100 (the ceiling in 2012). That means it takes a far bigger bite out of the pay of the middle class and the working poor than out of the rich.

So it turns out that all the billions being given away by the rich (for tax writeoffs) are actually going to the Opera:

"You're on your own" is a theme that Obama picked up -- and Reich adds an appendix about that in the latest edition of the book.

I wish he had footnotes. Like at least one, right here. I think that the vast majority of that reduction is thanks to private companies cutting research. (Or moving it, as he discusses later, to China and India.)

> In March 2012, Republicans in the House of Representatives approved a budget that would cut $3.3 trillion from low-income programs over the subsequent decade, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The biggest cuts would be in Medicaid, providing health care for the nation’s poor—forcing states to drop coverage for an estimated fourteen million to twenty-eight million low-income people. The Republican budget would also reduce food stamps for poor families by 17 percent ($133.5 billion) over the decade, leading to a significant increase in hunger—particularly among children. It would also reduce housing assistance, job training, and Pell grants for college tuition. In all, 62 percent of the budget cuts would come from low-income programs. Yet at the same time, the Republican budget would provide a substantial tax cut to the rich—who are already taking home an almost unprecedented share of the nation’s total income.

> Meanwhile, the nation has been cutting school budgets to shreds...

Footnote please! This is just not true at all. School funding in some places has been cut a little. In most places it's maintained.

> ...even though the size of America’s school-age population keeps growing. By 2015, an additional two million kids are expected to show up in our schools. Yet in 2012, twenty-three states reduced education spending, on top of cuts in 2011 and 2010. Education is one of the biggest expenses in state budgets. But states can’t run deficits—almost every state constitution forbids it—and tax revenues during the prolonged downturn have not kept up. Nor has the federal government come to the aid of the states.

> In 1914, Henry Ford announced he was paying workers on his Model T assembly line $5 a day—three times what the typical factory employee earned at the time. The Wall Street Journal termed his action “an economic crime,” but Ford knew it was a cunning business move. The higher wage turned Ford’s autoworkers into customers who could afford to buy Model Ts. In two years Ford’s profits more than doubled.

That's not actually the real reason Ford did that. Ford workers were only a very TINY, totally insignificant share of Ford's customers. Cars were like the Internet -- transforming everything and making the world smaller -- and Autoworkers back then were like high-tech workers today. Ford paid those rare, skilled workers a lot of money for the same reason Facebook or Google does today: they have to (and they have the profits to pay for it.) Yes, Ford paid more than other factories, but other factories weren't producing the most valuable

Ford today...not so generous:

> That was then. Now Ford Motor Company is paying its new hires about half what it paid its new employees a decade ago. Ford’s newest workers earn about $ 14 an hour, in contrast to the $ 25 an hour earned by new Ford workers in 2002 (adjusted for inflation). Ford also gives today’s new recruits a maximum of four weeks of paid time off a year; Ford workers used to get five weeks. And instead of receiving a guaranteed $ 3,000-a-month pension when they retire at age sixty, new hires must build their own “personal retirement plans,” to which Ford contributes less than $ 2,000 a year.

Same with GE:

> According to the Commerce Department, employee pay is down to the smallest share of the economy since the government began collecting wage and salary figures data in 1929. Meanwhile, corporate profits now constitute the largest share of the economy since 1929. In case you forgot, 1929 was the year of the crash that ushered in the Great Depression. In the years leading up to that crash, most employers forgot Henry Ford’s example. The wages of most American workers remained stagnant. The gains of economic growth went mainly into corporate profits and into the pockets of the very rich. American families maintained their standard of living by going deeper into debt. In 1929 the debt bubble popped. Sound familiar? It should. The same thing happened in the years leading up to the crash of 2008. And more recent data show the trends continuing. In other words, we still haven’t learned the essential lesson of the two big economic crashes of the last seventy-five years: when the economy becomes too lopsided— disproportionately benefiting corporate owners and top executives vis-à-vis average workers— it tips over. **The real reason the American economy tanked in 2008, and why we’re still struggling to recover, is that the basic bargain has been broken.** The big economic news isn’t the slow return of jobs. It’s the continuing drop in pay. Most of the jobs we’ve gained since the Great Recession pay less than the jobs lost during it.
<<locations 542-553>>

OK...so here's my primary disagreement with Reich and all the other Latter Day followers of H.G. Wells and Edward Bellamy. There was no bargain. There was never a bargain. American capitalism never sat the American working class down and said -- as Reich wishes they would do "again" -- "how about we give you a great life, and we'll all live happily together behind white picket fences -- would you like that?" What happened was American workers said to their Andrew Carnegies, J.P. Morgans, Henry Fords and Alfred P. Sloans: YOU NEED US. And they were not making it up.

They were not making it up. The U.S. economy was the world's powerhouse in the first half of the 20th century. Workers were not dumb. They saw their value. There was a particular ecosystem of labor talent, infrastructure and other conditions that made America (and Candada) the place to produce cars, trucks, planes, etc... -- i.e. the most valuable stuff of the day.

During and after WWII, the importance of North American workers skyrocketed even further because no basically no one had a standing economy.

American workers simply said (through strikes, fought sometimes in pitched battles against private and/or public militias) you have to pay us. The power of U.S. capitalism back then was such that workers became middle class at the same time that CEOs amassed fortuned TEN times larger than Bill Gates's, the Google Guys's or Mark Zuckerberg's.

When several MILLION workers stuck all around the same time -- repeatedly at various times throughout U.S. history -- that was no "Occupy Zuccotti Park." That was American workers setting their price on the market -- the same way that our three wireless providers set their price in the market. What's miraculous of course about what the workers did was that there were not three but thirty million of them.

But now this is what we're facing:

> An analysis from the National Employment Law Project shows that the biggest losses were in jobs paying between $19.05 and $31.40 an hour; the biggest increases have been in jobs paying an average of $9.03 to $12.91 an hour. For several years now, conservative

> It’s estimated the economy would grow by 2 percent in 2012, which is peanuts. The deeper the economic hole we’ve been in, the faster we need to grow in order to get back on track. Given the depth of the hole we fell into in 2008, we would need the economy to be growing by 4–6 percent in 2012 and at least that fast in 2013. Consider that in 1934, when the economy began emerging from the bottom of the Great Depression, it grew 7.7 percent. The next year it grew more than 8 percent. In 1936 it grew a whopping 14.1 percent.

Yes -- but the reason we were growing at those incredible rates was that we were China, basically. Whatever the world wanted, we were making it -- more efficiently than anywhere else.

> On the other hand, during periods when the very rich took home a larger proportion— as between 1918 and 1933, and in the Great Regression from 1981 to the present day— growth slowed, median wages stagnated, and the nation suffered giant downturns. It’s no mere coincidence that over the last century the top earners’ share of the nation’s total income peaked twice, in 1928 and 2007— the two years just preceding the biggest downturns.

Yes, we've been getting more productive. But here's the flaw in the liberal logic: Capitalists don't pay workers based on how productive they are compared to yesterday; they pay them based on how productive they are compared to all the workers+capital that are available to them. Right now, much better mixes of labor+capital are available to most capitalists in China and elsewhere than in the U.S.. Therefore, U.S. wages drop. Reich hates that it's true. But he knows it's true. Like the John Winthrop in 1640, he wants to throw the greedy capitalist in the stocks.

The only problem is, the greedy capitalist is the only one who knows how to set up an iron works. ...or is even interested in doing it.

He touches on the sea change in American life of the 20th century -- when American families were convinced to send two workers into the work force for half the pay each:

> Their spending was at first enabled by the flow of women into the workforce. In the 1960s, only 12 percent of married women with children under the age of six were working for pay; by the late 1990s, 55 percent were in the paid workforce. When that way of life stopped generating enough income, Americans went deeper into debt. From the late 1990s to 2007, the typical household debt grew by a third. As long as housing values continued to rise, it seemed a painless way to get additional money. Eventually, of course, the bubble burst.

> [From the 1970's...] with the continued gains from economic growth, the nation could have enabled more people to become the kinds of problem solvers and innovators that could summon higher pay—starting with early childhood education, better public schools, expanded access to higher education, and more efficient public transportation. The nation might also have enlarged safety nets—by having unemployment insurance cover part-time work, by giving transition assistance to those moving to new jobs in new locations, by creating insurance for communities that lost a major employer. And we could have ensured that our workforce and their families were healthy by making Medicare available to anyone. Big companies could have been required to pay severance to American workers they let go, and train them for new jobs. The minimum wage could have been pegged at half the median wage, and we could have insisted that the foreign nations we trade with do the same so that all citizens could share in gains from trade. We could have raised taxes on the rich and cut them for poorer Americans.

Since the mid-1990s, Germany has grown faster than the United States, and the gains from that growth have been more widely spread. While Americans’ average hourly pay has risen only 6 percent since 1985, adjusted for inflation, German workers’ pay has risen almost 30 percent. At the same time, the top 1 percent of German households takes home only about 11 percent of all income—the same as in 1970. And although in 2012 Germany was hit by the debt crisis of its neighbors, its unemployment was still below where it was when the financial crisis started in 2007. Germany has done it mainly by focusing like a laser on education (with regard to math scores, German students continue to extend their lead over American students) and by maintaining strong labor unions.

President Obama said the agreement would create more American jobs, but in fact it would create more profits for American companies and relatively few new jobs for Americans. Nearly half of the deal was for two hundred Boeing aircraft whose parts would be manufactured all over the world. The rest involved agricultural commodities that don’t require much U.S. labor (because American agribusiness is highly automated) and chemical and high-tech goods that are even less labor-intensive.

Elected representatives who receive virtual petitions know how little work they require relative to the exhausting tasks of knocking on doors to get signatures or getting out the vote. All too often, virtual organizations and movements are fleeting. Their “members” feel no loyalty or connection to one another. Direct contacts, on the other hand, are more enduring.

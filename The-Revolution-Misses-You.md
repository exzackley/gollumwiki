OK folks. This book is targeted mainly at twentysomething activists who are wrestling with big questions of how to actually improve the world they live in. I would appreciate your feedback. You can leave comments at the bottom of each page. If you'd rather just email me, that's fine too. 

It's still a rough draft! Also, I'm constantly changing it. In some cases, comments won't apply anymore because I changed the test they're referring to.

The chapter titles are just placeholders -- if you think of a good title for any, let me know in the comments.

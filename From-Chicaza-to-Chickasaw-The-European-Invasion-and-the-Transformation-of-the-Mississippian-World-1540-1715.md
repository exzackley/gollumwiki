From Chicaza to Chickasaw: The European Invasion and the Transformation of the Mississippian World, 1540-1715 by Robbie Ethridge

> Although it was not the only form of political organization extant in the Mississippian world, the chiefdom was the dominant political type. A chiefdom is a political order with basically two social ranks determined by kinship affiliations: ruling elite lineages and nonelite lineages. Generally speaking, the members of the chiefly lineage were considered related to supernatural beings, which gave them religious sanction for their status, prestige, and political ([288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=288))

> authority. The political and religious center of a chiefdom was a large town with an earthen temple mound fronted by a large plaza and often surrounded by other mounds (Figure 1). Neighborhoods of the common people typically surrounded the town center. The mico lived atop the temple mound, while lesser people of the chiefly lineage resided on the smaller mounds 4 ([299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=299))

> a mico's power. They generally agree that the chiefly elite constituted a centralized political body and that those members held permanent inherited offices of high rank and authority, with the mico holding the highest office. The mico had the authority to settle disputes, punish wrongdoers, make judgments, and command tribute, usually in the form of surplus production and labor. But it appears that an elite's consolidation of power varied from one chiefdom to another. In some cases, the mico held coercive if not autocratic power and consulted only with others of the elite lineage; but in other cases, the mico exerted influence and authority but not real power, and he or she deliberated with local town councils in addition to the elite lineage when making decisions.5 ([302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=302))

> If the Spaniards had come 300 years earlier and had traveled toward present-day St. Louis, Missouri, they would have seen Cahokia, the earliest and largest of all Mississippian polities, which was occupied during the Early Mississippi Period. At its height, around 1050–1200 C.E., Cahokia proper was an expansive center that covered six square miles, with a population of around 20,000 and over 100 mounds of various sizes. Cahokia's influence dominated the Early Mississippian landscape. And by the Middle Mississippi Period, the Mississippian way of life was firmly in place across most of the South. 8 ([334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=334))

> “complex chiefdom” was a political organization in which one large chiefdom exercised some sort of control or influence over smaller chiefdoms within a defined area. Archaeologists call the smaller chiefdoms “simple chiefdoms” because they were polities in which the elite only controlled the towns connected to that chiefdom. Simple chiefdoms were clusters of about four to seven towns, with one of these usually having only a single mound and serving as the center of the chiefdom. These towns were small, with an average population of 350 to 650 people, and a simple chiefdom, as a whole, had an average population of between 2,800 to 5,400 people. The average diameter of a simple chiefdom was about 20 kilometers (12.43 miles), while the average distance between simple chiefdoms was 30 kilometers (18.64 miles).9 ([344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=344))

> In the Late Mississippi Period, complex and simple chiefdoms existed side by side, and in a few cases single, especially charismatic leaders forged an alliance of several complex and simple chiefdoms into “paramount chiefdoms.” Archaeologists are not in agreement as to the specific organizational mechanisms that held a paramount chiefdom together. According to anthropologist Charles Hudson, whereas one can think of a simple chiefdom as a “hands-on, workaday administrative unit under the aegis of a particular chief, the paramount chiefdom may have been little more than a kind of non-aggression pact, and the power of a paramount chief may have been little more than that of first among equals.” In other words, paramount chiefdoms were political entities that could have ranged from strongly to weakly integrated, and paramount chiefs could have possessed power or merely influence. The concept of the paramount chiefdom, then, implies a less-centralized administration than larger, statelike organizations but a larger area of geographic influence than that of simple or even complex chiefdoms, sometimes spanning several hundred miles. 10 ([351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=351))

> Mounting archaeological evidence indicates the occurrence of a pattern of “cycling” in complex and simple chiefdoms—a seemingly endemic rise and fall of chiefdoms through time. For example, in the Savannah River area in present-day Georgia and South Carolina, there were a number of chiefdoms that rose and fell between 1100 and 1450 C.E., after which the area was abandoned until around 1660 C.E. How and why Mississippian chiefdoms rose and fell is poorly understood. Certain stresses such as soil exhaustion, drought, depletion of core resources, military defeat, and contested claims to the chieftainship may have constituted proximate causes for collapse. However, archaeologists generally agree that within a chiefdom, there also were inherent structural instabilities, most likely those associated with chiefly power, authority, and ascension.11 Chiefdoms, then, apparently could not withstand serious and prolonged external or internal stresses. ([359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=359))

> When a chiefdom fell, other chiefdoms around it did not necessarily fall. Archaeologists are beginning to understand that despite the cycling of chiefdoms, there was an overall regional stability in the Mississippian world. As David J. Hally demonstrates for present-day north Georgia, the chiefdoms in this area were integrated into a regional system of “interaction, interdependence, and the movement of energy, material, and information among polities.” When a chiefdom fell, a regional adjustment followed, as people joined other existing chiefdoms and new areas opened for the settlement and development of new chiefdoms. Ecological parameters also shifted to accommodate the new settlement layout. Hally proposes that the interplay between cycling chiefdoms and extant chiefdoms sponsored a sustained regional stability. 12 ([366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=366))

> This World was created when the creatures of the Upper World came down to live below, but the world got progressively impure, and finally they all left to return to the Upper World, leaving their inferior images behind to be the ordinary animals and spirits of This World. This World existed between the Above and Below Worlds and was therefore the dividing line and meeting ground for the two opposing worlds and their inhabitants20 ([434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=434))
Note: wow! Edit
The nineteenth-century Cherokee story of Corn Woman and Lucky Hunter is a sacred origin story. Corn Woman and Lucky Hunter, or First Man and First Woman, were human representatives in the Upper World. They were the first humans, but they had supernatural powers. First Man and First Woman figure much into Mississippian iconography, and Mississippian artists crafted statues and other sculptures in the likeness of them. The two were the central icons of the elite ancestor veneration, and the statues were kept in ossuaries atop the mounds.25 ([465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=465))

> In this cosmological order, the Above and Below Worlds were opposites of each other, and This World existed in between them. Mississippian beliefs, then, were organized according to dualistic oppositions such as Above World/Below World, man/woman, east/west, war/peace, and so on. Balance and purity were integral to these oppositions. Opposite categories existed in a balance, and when things were in balance, the cosmos was working according to plan. The cosmos was also in good order when things were pure, but purity required categorical tidiness. Humans in This World had been given the awesome responsibility of maintaining the balance, harmony, and purity of the cosmos. However, things could and would become unbalanced, disharmonious, or impure for any number of reasons. When that happened, humans had the divine charge to reinstate the order27 The late eighteenth-century Creeks believed that in the mythical past, the “Master of Breath,” Hisagita misi, revealed to humans the rituals and prayers necessary to reinstate and ensure purity and balance in This World. Hisagita misi was the divine creator who the Creeks believed created all things good and who dwelled in the Above World. In the late eighteenth century, these rituals, prayers, and small acts were known by many people, who could perform them to reinstate or ensure balance and purity as need be. However, in especially important affairs, the reinstatement of purity and balance sometimes required a ritual specialist. In Mississippian times, archaeologists believe, only the sacred elite had access to such sacred knowledge; the bearers of this knowledge would have constituted a class of ritual specialists or priestly elite. The priests therefore were responsible for and controlled the reinstatement of cosmic balance and purity. The mico, then, would not only have been the top political figure in the chiefdom but also the top religious figure. In fact, politics and religious ideology were probably inseparable, and Mississippian chiefdom political orders were true theocracies28 ([474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=474))

> In other areas of the Mississippian world, elite power and authority was signaled through their abilities to control such exotic goods. The Tombigbee elites, however, likely maintained their position through their abilities to marshal a cohesive defense against outside attacks and to facilitate food storage and protection by offering a safe place to store surplus foods at the palisaded mound centers52 In fact, archaeologists have theorized that the local center-farmstead polity was a response to living in the interface between two physiographic zones—the Fall Line Hills and the Black Prairie. 53 Because of the abundance of game in this area, especially white-tailed deer, in the late winter and fall people abandoned their farmsteads for communal hunting activities, and hence they were away from their towns for extended periods. Prior to leaving for the hunt, however, people would move their surplus agricultural stores to the local mound centers, where they could be stored and protected. Those not participating in the hunt, such as the elderly or very young, also likely relocated to the local centers at these times. In addition, during certain times of the year, all the people from the chiefdom came to the local mound center to participate in rituals and other activities. Elites living at the local centers organized and supervised these activities, by which they also gained some status and influence. From the kinds of grave goods found with many elites at the Lubbub Creek site, the best known of the Tombigbee chiefdoms, archaeologists believe that some category of elites also gained social and political stature from leadership in warfare 54 This pattern may have carried forward into the colonial era, when, as we will see, a dual-leadership pattern divided along war-and-peace lines characterized the Chickasaw political order 100 years later. ([624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=624))

> archaeologists are in disagreement over whether or not the province of Chicaza was a chiefdom, with a hierarchical social and politic structure, or an egalitarian, tribelike organization. One crucial piece of archaeological evidence that could help answer some of the questions about Chicaza is missing. Archaeologists have not found the site of Chicaza, nor any of the sites related to it, and scholars argue that the Soto narratives can be interpreted in different ways. 61 Those who interpret the current archaeological data as indicating that Chicaza was not a hierarchical, chiefdom society but a decentralized, egalitarian one argue that around 1450 C.E., when many of the chiefdoms located in the bottomlands of the central Tombigbee and its tributaries were abandoned, people moved northwest into the Black Prairie uplands. They note that the sites dating to the sixteenth century in the upland prairie are all small hamlets and that there are no upland-prairie mound sites. They interpret the absence of mound sites to mean that there were no central administrative centers typical of chiefdoms, and hence, the people were not under the political organization of a chiefdom. 62 ([659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=659))

> The current regional picture of Mississippian cycling shows that when a chiefdom collapsed, people did not simply move into the hinterlands as “tribal” level societies. Rather, they moved in patterned ways to join other functioning chiefdoms, or they relocated, took in other immigrants, and began reorganizing into a new chiefdom. The current regional picture of the Mississippian era also shows that “tribal” level societies existed only on the fringes of this world. The Mississippian world was a world of chiefdoms, and in a world of chiefdoms, a polity was constrained to be organized into a chiefdom—just as in a world of nations, polities are constrained to be organized into nations. But all nations are not equal, and failed nations, as we have learned, make life hard for everybody. Finally, a close examination of the documentary evidence supports the idea that Chicaza was a ranked society and chiefdom. As we will see, the army that Chicaza assembled and their methods of warfare were consistent with those of a ranked social order; the mico of Chicaza clearly had subordinate micos from neighboring polities; the ceremonial greeting between Soto and Chicaza were indicative of his high rank; and Chicaza clearly bore himself like a man of high status. ([691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=691))

> If the chiefdom of Chicaza was similar to the other Tombigbee chiefdoms, corn would have indeed been plentiful at harvest time. The farmers of the Tombigbee chiefdoms were of two sorts: those who lived at the local centers and cultivated nearby communal fields in the floodplains and small farming families dispersed across the chiefdom who planted small agricultural plots near their homes. In both cases, farmers planted corn, sunflowers, and beans, but they also harvested many wild foods, including various sorts of nuts, persimmons, plums, grapes, and maypops. But corn was their vegetable mainstay. 77 Deer undoubtedly provided Tombigbee residents with the bulk of their meat protein, although they also ate rabbit and squirrels. Alimamu and Miculasa brought Soto rabbits as a gift and the citizens of Chicaza on occasion supplied rabbits to the Spaniards, so the creatures must have been plentiful in the Black Prairie in the sixteenth century, as they still are today. Procuring deer meat in this particular environment required those in the small farmsteads to seasonally leave their homes in order to hunt, probably in the late fall and early winter. As discussed earlier, those not participating in the hunt moved to the local center, where they stored and protected their agricultural products under the watchful eye of the mico and his warriors. Hunting parties may have gathered here at this time for communal hunts and later for divvying up the meats. Ceremonies and feasts took place during this season as well, since people were congregated at the local center. Soto's arrival in early December, of course, would have disrupted all of this. 78 ([725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=725))

> Sometime during the winter, Chicaza approached Soto with a request for military aid against one of his subordinates, who was withholding his tribute to the mico. In the Mississippian world, withholding tribute from an overlord was tantamount to declaring independence. According to Elvas, Chicaza complained to Soto that one of his vassals had risen against him and was withholding his tribute. The offending polity was named Sacchuma, and the chief of Sacchuma was Miculasa, one of the micos Soto had met those first weeks at Chicaza. 85 Chicaza told Soto that he was about to go seek the rebellious mico in his own land and to “punish him as he deserved.”86 He then asked Soto for military aid in this punitive action. Soto commanded thirty horse soldiers and eighty foot soldiers to go with Chicaza, who, in the meantime, had gathered 200 armed warriors to accompany him. After crossing into the province of Sacchuma, the combined Indian and Spanish force came upon a palisaded town, but the people had fled, leaving it abandoned.87 Chicaza's army burned the town, and apparently Miculasa got the message. Upon their return to Chicaza, Miculasa made peace with Chicaza—meaning that he acknowledged his subservience to the mico.88 That Chicaza considered Miculasa a rebellious subordinate would indicate that Chicaza held some sort of chiefly power over adjacent polities. Really, though, the relationship between Chicaza, Miculasa, and Alimamu is difficult to decipher. ([770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=770))

> Many Mississippian towns and mound centers were fortified with tall, wooden walls and sometimes additionally surrounded by moats, and chiefdoms were separated by buffer zones. These facts indicate that warfare was chronic during the Mississippi Period. The iconography from the Mississippi Period is filled with war motifs and warrior figures, so much so that scholars believe warfare not only figured into much of Indian daily life but also much of their religious life. Items such as shell gorgets, ritual conch-shell cups, and copper plates depict mythical warriors—part human, part bird— in full battle regalia and in various poses, often performing war dances (Figure 4). Myths recorded by Spanish priests in the late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century, likewise, tell tales of mythical warriors engaged in mythic contests. War, then, was not just of this world but had a cosmic component that real-life Mississippian warriors hoped to reenact on their own battlefields.7 ([864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=864))

> Relations between chiefdoms could be fractious, competitive, and often-times hostile. Even so, chiefdoms also managed to form alliances with other polities, as in the cases of the complex and paramount chiefdoms that Soto saw and in the coordinated military assaults on Soto. Although the exact mechanisms for building and maintaining political and military alliances are poorly understood, the Soto documents show that alliances were maintained as much through military coercion and domination as through diplomacy and negotiation.8 One of the fundamental relationships between chiefdoms, then, may have been war. Paradoxically, it may have been war that held the Mississippian world together. ([871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=871))

> Because of the prevalence of war motifs in Mississippian art, and because much of this art was associated with elite burials, scholars understand that the Mississippian military order was part and parcel of the Mississippian political order. They also understand the military to have constituted one of three important theocratic institutions associated with the chiefly elite. Archaeologist J. Vernon Knight interprets the sacra of Mississippi Period iconography to represent three coexisting institutions. First, Knight identifies a communal institution that emphasized the earth, fertility, and purification and that had as its central icon the platform mound. The layering of mantles of earth on a mound at the death of the mico represented communal renewal and purification. Second is the chiefly institution that emphasized warfare, war, and warrior titles, and which also served to legitimate and sanctify chiefly authority through control over the rituals and spiritual underwriting of warfare and hence leadership. The icons associated with this institution are the well-known warrior and warfare ritual objects and motifs—artifacts such as the monolithic war clubs and motifs like the bilobed arrows, the falcon-warriors or birdmen, the severed heads, and so on. And third is a priestly institution that supervised the elaborate Mississippian mortuary rituals and ancestor veneration of the elite dead. The central icons of the priestly institution were the funerary goods and temple statuary. Although he identifies three institutions, Knight proposes that the communal and chiefly institutions were organizational opposites and that, at its center, Mississippian religion was a dyadic organization. He suggests that the priestly institution may have served to mediate between the chiefly and communal institutions.9 ([878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=878))

> Although the mico held the top position in the political-religious order, the duties of leadership were likely divided among the elite lineage. For example, the class of ritual specialists was probably drawn exclusively from the elite lineage. Among the elite lineage, then, there would have been elite priests and prophets who oversaw the warrior ethos, ancestor veneration, and the renewal ceremonies. We know from the eighteenth-century documentary evidence that many Southern Indian groups had an office of a “war priest” who was a specialist in the ceremonies and rituals associated with warfare and who ensured proper ceremonial decorum and ritual before, during, and after warfare. The Natchez, one of the few chiefdoms that survived into the eighteenth century, had an office of “Great War Chief.” In the early eighteenth century, Tattooed Serpent, the brother of the Great Sun, the Natchez mico, held this office.10 Whether the war priest and the war chief were two different offices or two appellates for a single office is not clear. ([891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=891))

> Although there is no direct evidence for war priests or war chiefs in the Mississippi Period, the presence of grave goods decorated with military iconography such as the Birdman and other military motifs in certain burials suggests that such an office existed. The most spectacular burial associated with the Falcon Warrior, or Birdman, is Mound 72 at Cahokia. Mound 72 is a small, oval mound in which over 250 people were interred. Of these 250 burials, two were highly regarded, elite men, as indicated by the richness of the grave goods associated with them. One of these elite men was buried atop a layer of over 20,000 shell beads deposited in the shape of a bird. At the same time, the other elite man was buried beneath the layer of shell beads. Several people were sacrificed and buried with them at the time the two elites were buried. Over the next several years, hundreds of other people were sacrificed and buried in the mound, their final resting places layered on top of the elite burials. Scholars have recently interpreted this astonishing burial to represent one of the mythic tales about Morning Star, surmising that the war chief/priest buried in the mound may have served as a metonymy of the mythic warrior Morning Star.12 ([904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=904))

> Mississippians were matrilineal, meaning that they traced descent through the female line. Each matriline was part of a larger kinship grouping known as the clan, and the clans were ranked. Likewise, the lineages in a clan were ranked. Among the Indians of Florida, the towns within a chiefdom were also ranked. Therefore, a simple chiefdom drew a mico from the highest-ranking member of the highest-ranking lineage in the highest-ranking clan of the highest-ranking community within the cluster of five to ten towns that constituted the chiefdom. The mico in these simple chiefdoms, however, did not have autocratic power. He or she presided over a chiefly council consisting of the headmen of each town, known in Muskogean as holatas or oratas. From accounts written during the 1566–68 Juan Pardo expeditions into present-day South Carolina and North Carolina, we know that the oratas occupied the first highest seats in the mico's council. The oratas also had their noble counselors or assistants, known as inihas or henihas. The henihas occupied the lower seats in the mico's council. The chief of the chiefdom was the highest-ranking orata, and he or she held the title of mico. All of the oratas were drawn from the highest-ranking lineage in the highest-ranking clan within their respective towns.13 Since clans crosscut towns, the highest-ranking clan in each town was most likely the mico's clan. Hence, all leadership posts came from the highest-ranking clan in the chiefdom. ([918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=918))

> Although all Mississippian men probably joined the military ranks once they became old enough and skilled enough for combat, men from the elite lineages likely joined the ranks at the upper echelons. For those with particularly good military minds, experiences in battle over their lifetime would also lend them some achieved status as war strategists and councillors. These men likely were the military leaders of subunits—what the Spanish called “captains”—and their job probably resembled that of their European counterparts. Nonelite men joined at the lower ranks and moved through a series of graded titles over their lifetime as they gained status and prestige through their exploits in war. Their experiences and ranks also would have given them a voice in the war councils. Among the Natchez, these accomplished men could enter into a titled rank that the French translated as Honored People (women, too, could enter the rank by sacrificing a child at the death of a Sun). The mico was the commander in chief, and the war chief or war priest would have been the second in command. The Honored People and warriors of rank would have constituted the war council.18 ([954](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=954))

> Once on the field of battle, the mico and his war chief, acting as field commanders, would issue orders to their captains and ranked warriors, who would then pass them to their subunits. In the case of allied chiefdoms joining forces, the paramount chief was the field commander; he issued orders to his subordinate micos, who then issued orders to their war chiefs, and so on down the line of command. In short, the graded-rank organization replicated the hierarchical political structure of the chiefdom and allowed a single chief to command hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of warriors.21 ([970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=970))

> There was no standing professional army in a chiefdom. As the need arose, warriors were drawn from the population of men in the chiefdom—or, in the case of complex or allied chiefdoms, from the men in the allied or subordinate chiefdoms.22 As one can see from the Soto narratives, Mississippian micos could mobilize and deploy their forces relatively quickly, as when the mico of Chicaza apparently fielded a 200-man force against Sacchuma in the course of a day. In cases where large forces were amassed, mobilizing the army would have taken a few days. ([974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=974))

> Mississippian war commanders used two basic strategies: guerilla or harassing raids and formal battles. ([982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=982))

> Offensive battles often employed an element of surprise, as we saw when Chicaza warriors attacked one of the border towns of Sacchuma. ([993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=993))

> Typically, once inside the town walls, warriors preferred hand-to-hand combat with war clubs. In fact, the war club, not the bow and arrow, was the main icon of masculinity and warfare. However, in confronting Soto's army, the hand-to-hand tactic became a lethal liability because of Spanish mounted lancers. ([997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=997))

> Organized, formal battles were of short duration. One reason for this was that the objective of such battles was not to occupy a town or chiefdom or annihilate an enemy but rather to subdue, punish, or incorporate them into one's own polity. This could be done through a series of raids and formal battles, and especially through the capture of the mico or other elites. Second, as Soto found out, an occupying army would soon face the problem of food shortages because there was not enough surplus in most chiefdoms to sustain a long-term occupation by a foreign army.29 Therefore, battles could be pitched and violent, but they typically did not last through the day. Time and again, as the Soto chronicles report, Indian forces attacked the Spaniards, only to quickly withdraw. As we will see, in the case of Chicaza, the warriors planned a second attack the following night, but this was canceled because of bad weather. The second attack came about a week later, but it was only a brief skirmish and was not repeated. ([1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1001))

> When targeting a mound center, offensive warfare often inflicted an element of desecration, as warriors would ransack the sacred temples that held the remains of their opponents’ ancestors as well as sacred grave offerings. ([1012](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1012))

> The attacking army would also single out the mico's house on the mound for destruction and pillaging. Soto witnessed this firsthand about a year later, when the Indians of Casqui, near the Mississippi River in present-day Arkansas, took advantage of Soto's alliance to attack their enemy, Pacaha.31 Successful offensive warriors also looted a defeated town for food and other items before burning it. Cloth, especially, was a favorite item.32 Taking captives, also, was a regular part of Mississippian warfare. In fact, according to Alonso de Carmona, one of Garcilaso's informants, Indian warriors had come to the battle of Chicaza with three cords tied around their waists—one for tying up a Spaniard, one for a horse, and one for a pig.33 ([1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1016))

> Mississippian warriors took human body parts as war trophies, and because male status was largely based on exploits in war, an attack usually resulted in “relatively indiscriminate slaughter,” as warriors would kill or maim anyone in order to obtain a war trophy. If any captives were taken, they were few in number and almost certainly young women.34 ([1025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1025))

> We know little about the fate of these Mississippian captives. Some may have been ritually killed or sacrificed, some may have been adopted or married into a family, and some may have been used as slaves. The Soto narratives mention that micos occasionally gave Soto slaves, so apparently slaves were used to garner allies or appease enemies. The only written account of the treatment of war captives from this time comes from Juan Ortiz, Soto's translator, who had been captured from the Narváez expedition off the coast of central Florida and held in captivity for twelve years before being released to Soto. Ortiz had been held in captivity by Uzita, the mico of a chiefdom by the same name (see Map 1). At first, Uzita determined to torture Ortiz to death and ordered him bound by hand and foot across a grill, underneath which a fire was built. Uzita's daughter, however, intervened, reasoning that a single Spaniard could not do them much harm and that it would be more to Uzita's honor to hold Ortiz as captive.35 ([1028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1028))

> Ortiz suffered greatly while in captivity under Uzita. He always wore some sort of cuff or shackle; he was deprived of adequate food and sleep; and he suffered daily beatings. Uzita also forced Ortiz to carry out daily tasks, such as fetching wood and water, and he subjected him to torturous games. At one festival, for example, he commanded Ortiz to run around the plaza without stopping, while Indian men shot arrows at him. ([1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1040))

> There is ample archaeological evidence of physical coercion of people during the Mississippi Period and some evidence that these people may have been war captives. The best examples of physical coercion are the famous retainer burials. As seen in the Mound 72 burials at Cahokia, when a chief died, men and women were often killed and buried with him or her. In fact, in one stupendous burial episode at Mound 72, four men with their heads and hands cut off and fifty-three young women (aged fifteen to thirty) were sacrificed. At their deaths, the women were undernourished and hence probably of a lower status than the elites. Bioarchaeologists also believe that most of these women were from populations outside of Cahokia proper, and they suggest that they likely were war captives.38 ([1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1047))

> For the first fifty or so years after the entrada, the people of Chicaza scattered into small towns and farmsteads in the uplands of the Black Prairie. They also quit building mounds, signaling a decline of the hierarchical political order. Corn still played an important part in their diet, but they began to balance their corn intake with more wild plant and animal foods. To facilitate this new subsistence, people moved onto small bluffs overlooking small streams, which gave them access to both wild game and the good friable soils of the upland prairies. They began hunting bison. There is also some suggestion that instead of spreading over the land in a random pattern, they clustered their small towns and farmsteads together in proximity to one another. As we have seen elsewhere in the lower South, people in northeast Mississippi also went from burying their dead in flexed positions directly in the ground to secondary urn and bundle burials, which archaeologists understand to suggest a leveling of social hierarchy.37 Like the people of Chicaza, the people of Alimamu also migrated out of the Tombigbee region. In Soto's day, the Alimamu province was probably north of Line Creek in present-day northeast Mississippi. About 140 years later in 1684, the people of Alimamu had relocated their towns to central Alabama as indicated by a census taken that year by the Spanish official Marcos Delgado (see Map 2). Delgado, who was making a reconnaissance of present-day central Alabama for Spanish officials, recorded several towns on the present-day upper Alabama River, including the towns of Aymamu (Alimamu) and Qulasa (Miculasa).38 It is also interesting that the Lyon's Bluff ([1396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1396))

> Recent archaeological investigations on the lower Tallapossa River indicate that the hereditary hierarchical leadership of these chiefdoms did not collapse after contact. Archaeologist Cameron Wesson presents a convincing case that the prestige-goods economy of the Late Mississippian Tallapossa chiefdoms shifted from a system of elite-centered, prestige-good exchange to one in which the elites seem to have been under duress to control the influx of new prestige items coming from Spanish and later English sources. The elite leaders initially attempted to control the flow of goods by hoarding them. However, over the seventeenth century, as more and more goods became available, a greater number of people had access to these goods, thereby intensifying the challenge to elite authority and prestige.59 Wesson's argument squares well with the documentary evidence. Scholars have long glossed over a seeming paradox in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century eyewitness accounts of Indian life that describe, on the one hand, egalitarian, council-governed political bodies, and on the other hand, clear patterns of inherited leadership roles. Hereditary leadership, as Wesson demonstrates, did not wholly collapse to be replaced by an egalitarian system of governance. Instead, the evidence now suggests that hereditary leadership persisted, perhaps into the nineteenth century, except that it was being continually challenged, strained against, and thwarted by tendencies toward decentralization and a more democratic form of government that characterized the coalescent societies of the eighteenth-and nineteenth-century Native South. Such political tensions and restructuring would have entailed realigning the relationship between commoners and elites, and scholars are beginning to turn their attention to how this realignment may have occurred. For example, archaeologists Gregory Waselkov and Ashley Dumas, in examining particular decorations that appear on ceramics relatively suddenly across much of the South in the early to mid-seventeenth century, propose that the ceramics may reflect a revitalization movement that arose in the seventeenth century in response to the social, political, and cultural turmoil in which Southern Indians found themselves. Scholars have long recognized the continuities between Mississippian beliefs and those of Historic Period Indians. Even so, we can also now see that a dramatic shift occurred in ideology. This shift was not toward an entirely new belief system; rather, it was a shift in interpretations of the same core set of assumptions and beliefs by which Mississippian people understood the cosmos. However, much of Mississippian religious beliefs were part of a legitimizing ideology for hereditary authority and elite privilege and status, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of iconographic materials were owned and controlled by the elite, and that Mississippian myths link elites to creation and ceremony. Any political restructuring, then, would have necessitated some new religious interpretations. ([1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1528))

> A close comparison of Mississippian and Historic Period beliefs show just such reinterpretations. For example, Mississippian myths that sanctified and legitimized elite authority were reinterpreted during the Historic Period to address such things as instructing people on how to perform the rituals and legitimizing political alliances. Some of the sacred Mississippian iconography, such as the looped square, was used into the eighteenth century, only now it appeared not on just elite or ceremonial wares but also on the everyday wares of the common people. The mounds—those architectural symbols of sacred political hierarchy—began to lose their significance and eventually disappeared during the seventeenth century. They were replaced by the square grounds, the meeting place of a new kind of body politic that was more inclusive and less ascribed. Waselkov and Dumas suggest that as such shifts in belief and governance occurred, challengers to the Mississippian traditional hierarchy sought their own legitimizing ideology. In particular, they suggest that ceramic designs, such as the looped square, harken back to Mississippian symbols of This World—the world of humans. If their interpretations of the ceramic evidence is correct, as people increasingly lost faith in the elite hierarchy, they forged a new ideology by reinterpreting long-held beliefs and shifting emphasis from the supernatural realms of the Upper World and Under World to the human realm of This World. Hence, the emphases on the looped-square design representing This World. Indeed, the square ground itself can be seen as a symbol of This World, the domain of humans. Such shifts, of course, would not go uncontested by those in the chiefly lineages, and thus dramatic reinterpretations that challenged chiefly authority and sacredness may have required a widespread revitalization movement such as that suggested by Waselkov and Dumas.60 ([1550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1550))

> Spanish goods and skins were not the only exchanges being made; diseases, too, would have followed the trade links. Most scholars agree that the introduction of Old World diseases into virgin-soil populations of the Americas resulted in a demographic collapse on the order of 90 percent across the hemisphere. However, scholars are still not certain about the exact diseases that were introduced, when they were introduced, or their specific pathologies, among other things. Moreover, in recent years, the idea that disease alone was responsible for the dramatic loss of Indian life in the first 100 or so years after contact has come into question71 Today, scholars agree that disease was but one factor in the demographic collapse, and all point to contributing factors such as slaving, internecine warfare, dropping fertility rates, violent colonial strategies such as genocide, and general cultural and social malaise from colonial oppression.

## Chapter 4 The English Invasion and the Creation of a Shatter Zone, ca. 1650–1680

> Hernando de Soto's grim swath of destruction and disruption, and even the presence of the Spanish in La Florida and introduction of Old World disease, cannot account for the decline of Mississippian polities and the restructuring that took place across the whole of the American South over the seventeenth century. Certainly, Soto's presence disrupted much, and that, along with subsequent disease epidemics and cultural exchanges with later Spaniards, had profound impacts on Native life during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. But these disruptions, epidemics, and exchanges, in and of themselves, were not fully transforming. Rather, it was the introduction of a new economic system ushered in by a commercial trade in Indian slaves and skins that completed the constellation of forces that created the Mississippian shatter zone. In effect, then, not until Native peoples became engaged in the world economy through contact with the English, French, and Dutch did they revamp their social, political, and economic orders. The inauguration of a nascent capitalist economic system by Europeans through a commercial trade in Indian slaves and animal skins, and the consequent intensification and spread of violence and warfare with the emergence of militaristic Native slaving societies, were fundamental causes of the collapse and transformation of the Mississippian world and the reshaping of its geopolitical landscape.1 ([1652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1652))

> It was not Quebec, New Amsterdam, Jamestown, or Charlestown that created the Mississippian shatter zone; it was the global commercial power of the Netherlands, England, and France as funneled through these settlements.3 ([1671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1671))

> Throughout the seventeenth century, England, France, Spain, and Holland established “beachheads of empire” along the Atlantic seaboard and into the Gulf of Mexico (Table 1).5 These four European colonizers struggled to establish empires in North America, and each employed different strategies to engage and incorporate Native allies into their imperial designs. Like the Spanish expeditions, the English, Dutch, and French colonial projects in North America had political, religious, and military dimensions. However, by the seventeenth century, Spain was in decline as a commercial world power, and the Dutch, French, and English colonial projects carried significant commercial dimensions; that is, they came to North America to make money. As soon as English, French, and Dutch settlers landed on North American shores, they set about this business, and they brought with them strong commercial connections in the nascent global capitalist economy. By the early 1620s, the Dutch, English, and French had established colonies and trade interests in the St. Lawrence, Chesapeake, Susquehanna, and Hudson River corridors, and each lost no time in recruiting Native allies in the skin and slave trade.

> As we have seen, slavery was not completely new to North American Indians at the time of contact, and most Native groups practiced an indigenous form of slavery in which war captives sometimes were put into bondage. However, the large-scale captive taking that occurred during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was most likely not conducted in precontact times. Rather, it came about with the colonial commercial slave trade. In the South, then, the forms of bondage during the Historic Period that Europeans observed may not have existed in the Mississippi Period.6 ([1697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1697))

> Among the Southern Indians, though, the vast majority of captives were sold to Europeans, who then sold them on the slave market. European slavers shipped Indian slaves to the West Indies and South America to work on the plantations and in the mines, as well as to New England, French Canada, and French Louisiana, where they were used as domestic servants, concubines, urban laborers, and small-scale agricultural laborers. Some were sold to planters and others in Jamestown and, after 1670, in Charlestown. In fact, one accounting put the number of Carolina households with Indian slaves at 26 percent between 1710 and 1714.9 ([1706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1706))

> In other words, whereas trading in furs or deerskins does not necessarily involve warfare, trading in slaves does, because it requires force. Certainly, warfare penetrated Mississippian life, so much so that war, not peace, may have been the accepted prevailing state of affairs. Once Europeans arrived, one can see that Native war efforts became entwined with market interests and international commerce. As warfare became tied to commercial interests, the southern chiefdoms’ mechanisms for mitigating war and brokering peace broke down, and thus as Indian commercial interests intensified, so did warfare and the militarization of those Native groups who sought to control the trade. Given the intrachiefdom hostility evident in the Mississippian world, one can assume that people of a chiefdom had a ready supply of enemies whom they could target in their raiding. Let there be no doubt, however, that the commercial trade in Indian slaves was not a continuation and adaptation of preexisting captivity patterns. It was a new kind of slaving, requiring a new kind of occupational specialty created on the edge of the modern world system: organized militaristic slavers. One consequence of this militarization was the emergence of “militaristic slaving societies.” These were Indian societies that gained control of the trade and, “through their slave raiding, spread internecine warfare and created widespread dislocation, migration, amalgamation, and, in some cases, extinction of Native peoples.”13 Most of these militaristic slaving societies were short-lived, existing for only about 100 years (from 1620 to 1715). During this brief window of time, they were key agents in the creation and expansion of the Mississippian shatter zone through their relentless raiding of their Indian neighbors for slaves. One of the first militaristic slaving societies to emerge out of this new colonial context were the Five Nations Iroquois, who lived in present-day New York. At some point just prior to European contact, the Mohawks, Onondagas, Oneidas, Senecas, and Cayugas, who were situated between the Mohawk and Genesee River valleys in New York, joined in “The Great League of Peace and Power.” The Great League was an alliance that guaranteed peace among its members and mutual aid against outside aggressors. The Iroquois lost no time in establishing ties with Europeans as soon as the latter had established trade depots in the Northeast. Through much violence against their neighbors and others, the Iroquois became the dominant middlemen in the new trade ([1723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1723))

> Some scholars maintain that northern businessmen prized furs (beaver and other furs) and not Indian slaves as their most valuable commodity, and that the intra-Indian competition for access to the fur trade lay at the root of the northeastern Indian conflict and hostility.14 Still, the Iroquois practice of obtaining war captives folded into commercially inspired wars. Before the European invasion, much Iroquois warfare was conducted as “mourning wars,” the objective of which was to take captives who were then used to replace their deceased through a ceremony known as “requickening.” The mourning wars created low-level, perhaps chronic violence. However, Europeans introduced two factors that powerfully reshaped the mourning wars: disease and trade.15 ([1743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1743))

> The first recorded instance of Old World disease among the Iroquois appeared in the 1630s and was followed by successive waves of disease epidemics in 1647, 1656, 1661, 1668, 1673, and 1676, so that by the end of the seventeenth century, they had suffered an estimated 95 percent population loss. With this kind of loss, the mourning wars took on vastly increased significance: they were necessary to keep Iroquois numbers up.16 In addition, this increase in ([1749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1749))

> warfare left the Iroquois with a disproportionate number of young men eager to avenge and replace the dead, and who, because of their connections to the European trade, were gaining more confidence in their abilities to challenge traditional Iroquois authority.17 ([1752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1752))

> There is increasing evidence that the Powhatan paramount chiefdom of Pocahontas fame—which appears to have been a relatively stable political unit on the northeastern edge of the Missis-sippian shatter zone—also took in refugees and may have even congealed politically in response to the social turmoil on all sides.26 ([1781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1781))

> Another early example of a militaristic slaving society is the Westos. The Westos were originally a group of Eries who, fleeing Iroquois predations, moved to the Ohio River, where they formed a partnership with the Susque-hannocks in the fur and perhaps the slave trade. ([1813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1813))

> From 1650 until about 1685, the Occaneechis and Westos, armed with European guns and employing a well-honed predatory strategy, conducted slave raids for their English partners against many of the Natives in present-day Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and perhaps as far west as present-day central Alabama (see Map 4).34 To make matters worse, in the late 1670s the Iroquois, reeling from a devastating epidemic, initiated a massive mourning war. Iroquois warriors now struck out west, where they raided the Hurons, Wyandots, Illinois, and other groups, and south, where they warred against the Indians of Carolina (see Map 4). Iroquois leaders allied with the Susquehannocks, who had been raiding throughout the mid-Atlantic and into the lower piedmont for at least two decades. Iroquois and Susquehannock raiders now filtered into Virginia and Carolina and harassed local Indians for the next three decades.35 The people of the Mississippian world, already navigating through a series of chiefdom failures, disease episodes, a weakening of chiefly authority, and various other challenges, now had to contend with armed slave raiders as well. The effects of Westo, Occaneechi, and Iroquois slaving reverberated through much of the American South. The coastal mission chiefdoms of Guale and Mocama were some of the first to suffer from Indian slaving.36 In fact, as early as 1620, Spanish authorities were reporting that Chiscas were raiding mission Indians. In these raids, Chiscas would kill many men and carry off many women and children. There is no evidence that the Chiscas were selling these Indians to European slavers, and the fact that they only had two guns in a 1677 battle with the Apalachee and Spanish also implies that these captives were not sold to Europeans.37 Despite the continuous harassment by the Chiscas, it was Westo slaving that took the heaviest toll on the mission Indians. ([1820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=1820))

> Scholars are not in agreement over which of the known sixteenth-century Cherokee archaeological sites Soto and Pardo visited. However, they do agree that in the sixteenth century, people in these river valleys were organized into simple chiefdoms, and that sometime after the expeditions, they quit building mounds. They also moved some of their towns from the northeast toward the southwest between 1600 and 1700 and were actively taking in refugees from other fallen polities. There is some documentary evidence that the Cherokees and Yuchis may have teamed up to raid the Guales as early as 1680; thus, they were either working with or bypassing the Westos and Occaneechis, and most likely it was the former. Unfortunately, the archaeological chronology from this region is rather long (from 1540 to 1670), and therefore we do not yet know if the mound building ceased and the movement of towns occurred because of Spanish perturbations or because of seventeenth-century slaving by the Occaneechis, Westos, and Iroquois—although both probably contributed to the general instability documented in the archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence.64 ([2046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2046))

## Chapter 5 Eastern Shock Waves on Western Shores, ca. 1650–1680 

> As the Atlantic seaboard became a shatter zone, shock waves from these disruptions began emanating out of the east and reverberating throughout the lower South to the Mississippi River valley and beyond. At the time of the Hernando de Soto expeditions, the central and lower Mississippi River valley was home to some of the most powerful, populous, and impressive polities through which the Spaniards had passed.1 French explorers paddling down the Mississippi 130 years later did not encounter any of these. What happened to the Indians of the central and lower Mississippi Valley between the mid-sixteenth and late seventeenth centuries, however, is poorly known. Only one thing is certain: whatever changes that were wrought occurred before the sustained presence of Europeans. After Soto, no Europeans ventured into this region until Joliet and Marquette made their voyage down the Mississippi in 1673. Several scholars have proposed that high losses from introduced disease precipitated the collapse and abandonment of the polities in the central and lower Mississippi Valley. One of the major impacts of European contact certainly was the introduction of Old World diseases. And there is some small evidence for the presence of disease in the Mississippi River valley before sustained European contact. Scholars document possible and probable disease episodes in the southern plains as early as 1535 and into the mid-seventeenth century, as well as early seventeenth-century disease episodes in the upper Mississippi River valley. As we will see, people in the central and lower Mississippi Valley had much contact with Indian populations to the north, west, and east, and disease could have entered this region through these connections sometime prior to the mid-seventeenth century. Even so, scholars now agree that any loss of life from disease was not a sudden collapse but rather a continuous drain of population over 100 or more years through serial episodes of disease.2 Scholars also acknowledge that changes in Native life that took place after European contact were not solely due to disease but also to contributing factors such as slaving, increased violence, and entry into commercial trade. Disease episodes certainly tore continually at Mississippian life, but we can no longer single out disease as the sole factor for collapse. Indeed, as I argue here, the shock waves from the disruptions occurring with Native participation in the European trade system penetrated far beyond the beachheads of empire. Shock waves reached the Mississippi River valley well before Europeans arrived, and they set in motion a sequence of events, movements, opportunities, and failures that had changed Indian life before Joliet, Marquette, La Salle, and all the other Frenchmen and their Indian allies canoed down the Mississippi River in the late seventeenth century.3 Indeed, disease was probably an important factor, but it was not the only factor. Rather, we have also to consider events happening on the Atlantic seaboard, especially those concerned with the colonial trade system. ([2125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2125))

> After Soto's death, with mutiny in the air, Moscoso decided the expedition was finished and that the army should return to Mexico. He first determined to go overland, since the reports of the earlier explorer Cabeza de Vaca indicated that such was possible. In their search for an overland route, the army moved through southwestern Arkansas into northeastern Texas. In Texas they came across several small towns in the transitional zone between the woodlands and the prairie: Nisohone, Lacane, Nondacao, Aays, Soacatino, and Guasco (see Map 1). These towns only minimally resembled the Mississippian towns through which the Spaniards had passed, and the narratives describe them as having small populations with little corn. The one exception was the paramount chiefdom of Naguatex on the Red River in western Arkansas. Still, at all of these towns, the Spaniards were disappointed to learn that beyond their borders lay the land of buffalo hunters, no corn, and few towns. The Spaniards had come to the western edge of the Mississippian world; beyond this were buffalo hunters living in widely dispersed camps whose descendants would later become part of the Witchita and Pawnee confederacies in the late seventeenth century.16 Moscoso and his councillors, realizing that these buffalo hunters could not support what was left of the army, decided that an overland trek was too risky; they opted to take their chances on the Mississippi River instead. They returned to the Mississippi River chiefdoms, this time spending the winter of 1542–43 at the populous chiefdom of Aminoya and building the seven boats they would use for their descent down the river. Aminoya was on the Mississippi River likely near the present-day Desha-Phillips county line, about twenty miles north of the mouth of the Arkansas (see Map I).17 ([2210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2210))

> On July 4, 1542, as the Spaniards readied their boats, they were awed and frightened at the sight of over 100 canoes on the river. The chroniclers marveled at the sheer size of the water craft; the larger canoes held about thirty paddlers on each side as well as about thirty warriors lined down the center. The crews sang songs to keep their paddle strokes in unison. In some cases, the boats, the clothing of the crew, and the awnings for the commanders were all of a single color. The whole navy observed strict discipline and order.20 ([2236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2236))

> All of the Soto chroniclers remarked that the Mississippi River polities—Aquijo, Casqui, Quiguate, Pacaha, Anlico, Guachoya, Aminoya, and especially Quigualtam—were the best they had encountered in all of their time in La Florida. These Mississippi River chiefdoms greatly impressed the Spaniards with their large towns, well-organized militaries and navies, abundance of foodstuffs, and large populations. Given the size, organization, and prosperity of the chiefdoms in the central and lower Mississippi Valley, it is surpassingly strange that most were no longer in evidence when French expeditions landed on the banks of the Arkansas River 130 years later. In 1673 Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette, the first Europeans since Soto to explore the central Mississippi Valley, traveled down the river from the mouth of the Wisconsin River. Other than a small town of Illinois Indians about 200 miles downstream, a notable display of rock art just north of the Missouri River (which was rumored to be the home of a human-eating monster), and an encounter with Indians with guns observing them from the riverbank just below the mouth of the Ohio, they found little to remark upon.24 ([2260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2260))

> This small party stayed at Fort Prudhomme for around ten days. During this time, French scouts combed the vicinity, and one of them captured two men. When the French scouts brought the two men into camp, La Salle inquired of them who they were. Neither La Salle nor any of his companions understood their language, but the men signaled in the trade sign language that they were “Chicacha” and that they were four or five days from their towns. The people of Chicaza whom Soto met in 1540 were likely the forebears of the Chicachas whom La Salle met in 1682—who were unmistakably the forebears of the eighteenth-century Chickasaws. The story of these two unnamed Chickasaw men, although short, is the first documentary evidence of the Chickasaw Indians in their homelands since the visit of the Soto expedition.31 ([2307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2307))

> Upon further interrogation of the two Chickasaws, La Salle's lieutenant, Henri de Tonti, also learned that their towns had about 2,000 warriors (or about 7,000 people). La Salle also noted in his memoirs that they all had “flat heads,” referencing the cranial deformation that was popular among many Southern Indians at the time. Although never having traveled this far south, La Salle and his Canadian and Indian companions knew about the Chickasaws and had heard that the Chickasaw Indian towns were south of the mouth of the Ohio River, yet at some remove from the Mississippi River. In fact, just two years earlier in 1680, a joint Chickasaw, Osage, and Quapaw delegation had come to the Kaskaskia mission on the Illinois River to solicit a trade partnership with the French.32 ([2313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2313))

> Since La Salle and his scouts, while at Fort Prudhomme, canvassed much of the same area in which Quizquiz had been located; since they never mentioned the polity; and since Chickasaw men freely roamed this territory, it is safe to say that by 1682 Quizquiz was no more. The French also made no mention of Aquijo, whose navy had so impressed Soto, indicating that this polity, too, was now gone. This account also corroborates that the Chickasaws had already relocated to the present-day Tupelo area by this time, since that location would have put them about 100 miles east of present-day Memphis—which squares with the four to five days that the Chickasaw scouts had told La Salle the trip would be. ([2329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2329))

> In another scenario, researchers present evidence that Anlico and the other chiefdoms along the Arkansas went into decline sometime after Soto, and that the Quapaws migrated to this valley sometime in the mid-to late seventeenth century as part of a large-scale exodus of Dhegiha Siouan peoples—the Quapaws, Osages, Omahas, Poncas, and Kansas—from the Ohio River, driven out by eastern Indian slaving (see Map 4). One piece of documentary evidence for this migration is that the Illinois and Miami Indians told Father Gravier in 1701 that they called the Ohio River the “Akansa” because the Akansas (Quapaws) “formerly dwelt on it.” Recently, archaeologists investigating the Wallace Bottom site propose that this site rather than the Menard site may represent Osotouy, and the Native artifact assemblage from here indicates a seventeenth-century migration into the area. This later scenario corroborates Quapaw oral traditions, which relate that they and the Osages migrated west together but split at the Mississippi River, with the Osages continuing up the Missouri and the Quapaws moving south. Once at the mouth of the Arkansas River, the Quapaws then forced out a local group, whom they specify were Tunicans.40 ([2386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2386))

> What is interesting for our story is that Indians all along the central and lower Mississippi Valley greeted the French explorers with the calumet ceremony. Soto, on the other hand, was never greeted with a ceremony such as those described in the French documents, and archaeologists do not find calumet pipes from Mississippi Period sites. The conclusion is that the ceremony was not practiced in the Mississippian world but rather diffused into the South sometime after Soto and well before the French explorations of the late seventeenth century. La Salle carried a calumet with him explicitly for greeting rituals, and he used it all down the Mississippi River until he met the Quinipissas, who were on the lower reaches of the river and rejected his offer. Whether the Quinipissas rejected it because of their suspicions or because they were unfamiliar with the ceremony is not known. But seventeen years later, when Iberville canvassed the mouth of the Mississippi River, all of the groups there smoked the calumet, including the Quinipissas.44 ([2418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2418))
Note: perfect example of how things changed just as fast and how culture spread just as far back then as now. Edit
Archaeologist Ian Brown, examining the timing of the introduction of catlinite elbow pipes typical of the calumets, believes that the ceremony entered the South via the Mississippi Valley in the early to mid-seventeenth century. He reasons that at that time, the whole of the Mississippi Valley was in turmoil, with many people being displaced or worse because of introduced diseases, eastern slaving, the migration of the Illinois into the valley, and the intense jockeying for position in the new trade system. Alliances were shaky; tensions were so taut that violence could erupt over the least infraction; and warfare was on the rise. Something was needed to quell these dark undercurrents and to reinstate some sort of balance, something to allow some modicum of normalcy—and especially the essential trade—to continue. The calumet ceremony served this purpose, and its quick spread throughout the Mississippi Valley and into the interior South attests to its positive function in a time of great uncertainty. By the end of the Mississippian shatter-zone era in the early eighteenth century, the practice had fallen into disuse.45 By that time, even the calumet could not assuage the distrust, tensions, and fears unleashed by the Indian slave trade.

> The stretch of the Mississippi River from the Arkansas River to present-day Natchez, Mississippi, encompasses the lower Yazoo River basin and the Natchez Bluffs, areas that have both received a fair amount of archaeological work. Certainly, one of the most spectacular historical moments for the area was between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the local Coles Creek culture fused with Mississippian influences emanating from the north to produce what archaeologists call the Plaquemine culture. Plaque-mine came to extend from the Yazoo basin to near the mouth of the Mississippi River and encompassed much of present-day western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. This is the time we see the emergence of several grand chiefdoms, represented today by archaeological sites such as the Lake George and Winterville sites in the Yazoo basin and the Windsor and Anna sites in the Natchez Bluffs, all of ([2482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2482))

> which were on the Mississippi River. Around 1500 C.E., the Yazoo basin became fully Mississippian, but the Natchez Bluffs region remained Plaquemine. The size of mound centers in the Yazoo basin declined at this time, replaced by small centers located away from the Mississippi River and toward the Yazoo River drainage. The one exception was the Glass site, a large Mississippian center located on the Mississippi River. A substantial buffer zone stretched south from the Glass site to the area of present-day Natchez. The Glass site is one of the contenders for the main town of Quigualtam, and the diminishment of former mound centers in the Yazoo basin may indicate the empire building of this ambitious mico. In the Natchez Bluffs, the large mound centers were abandoned or diminished by 1500 C.E., but another magnificent center arose at the Emerald site. Although it is not directly on the river, the Emerald site is also a candidate for the central town of Quigualtam; it could also have been the central town of the polity abutting Quigualtam's southern border and perhaps subordinate to it at the time of Soto.55 ([2488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2488))

> Sometime after 1550, all of these chiefdoms began to decline. In the Yazoo basin, there was a dramatic decrease in population, although whether this decrease was the result of an increased number of deaths from disease and warfare, emigration out of the basin, or both, is not known. This decrease left much of the basin open to immigration, and throughout the Historic Period, various groups moved into and out of the Yazoo basin. Archaeologically, the only known sites from this period are situated at or near the mouth of the Yazoo, and a few small sites exist along the Natchez Trace. Only one small mound site continued to be occupied into the seventeenth century (the Haynes Bluff site, which is just up from the mouth of the Yazoo), but the people had quit building mounds and, as later French documents indicate, the use of the extant mounds was also in decline. Some of the Historic Period Yazoo basin groups—such as the Yazoos and Chakchiumas, who were near present-day Greenwood, Mississippi, in the late seventeenth century—may have been the direct descendants of Yazoo basin chiefdoms, while others—such as the Tunicas, Koroas, and Ofos (or Ofogoula, perhaps another name for the Mosopelea)—were most likely recent immigrants (see Maps 4 and 5).56 ([2496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2496))

> In his memoir, written several years after the visit and after two more trips down the Mississippi, Tonti elaborated on Taensa. In particular, Tonti told about retainer burials in which, upon the mico's death, the people sacrificed his youngest wife, his house steward (maître d'hotel), and 100 men “to accompany him into the other world.” ([2539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2539))

> waterways. The Quinipissas and Houmas may have experienced a similar trajectory. The coastal Indians and the refugees that began to settle around them would later come to be known by the French as the petites nations.74 About a league downstream from the Quinipissa town, the La Salle expedition came upon a macabre scene. In the words of Minet: “First we noticed something like many people, when we had landed, we saw that the crowds were crows, eagles, and other beasts that seek out carrion. We knew by this that the village had been destroyed. On approaching, we saw only carcasses of men and women, ruined huts, and others full of dead bodies, a coating of blood on the ground, and all their canoes broken and cut up with axes.”75 This was the Colapissa town of Tangibao (see Map 5). Taking heed, the La Salle expedition did not tarry in Tangibao and continued downstream. At one point, as supplies were dwindling, the party espied a canoe with three Indians in it. The Indians, upon seeing the French, landed the canoe, abandoned it, and fled through the woods. Some of the French inspected the canoe and found some smoked alligator and another piece of meat; they tasted the latter and realized, to their dismay, that it was human flesh from the ribs of a man. Nicolas de la Salle and Minet both remarked that it was better than alligator meat, and Father Membre actually described the taste as “very good and delicate.”76 ([2627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2627))

> other French saw on the Mississippi River? The collapse of the central Mississippi Valley and the diminishment of those in the lower valley is one of the greatest historic puzzles of the early colonial South. We still do not have a good sense of why the central valley chiefdoms fell or where their people went. As we have seen, it looks as though some of the survivors migrated west up the Arkansas River. Some may have moved to the Red River, where they joined local Caddoan-speaking chiefdoms. Some moved south to the confluence of the Yazoo River, while others moved farther downstream to join Natchez and Taensa. Those that did not join existing chiefly orders did not reconstitute their chiefdoms; they either joined other small, nonchiefdom groups or maintained some degree of social and political independence.92 ([2762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2762))

> From the Soto records and the archaeological evidence, we know that the central Mississippi Valley chiefdoms were in a state of shifting alliances. Soto was directly involved in the political and military jockeying between Guachoya and Anlico and between Casqui and Pacaha, and it is likely that his presence upset the balance of power in the region. Still, it is puzzling as to why these power struggles could bring down all of these impressive chiefdoms. Certainly, Old World diseases would have contributed to any instabilities brought by Soto, but one must also consider the indirect effects of the Atlantic slave and fur trade and the shock waves emanating from east to west. The migration of the Illinois to the upper Mississippi surely affected those downstream, and the migration of refugees out of the Atlantic seaboard also had repercussions for those living on the Mississippi River—such as the contest that perhaps occurred between the Quapaws and Tunicas. So, in considering the postcontact history of this region, one must examine the effects of shock waves rippling throughout the Mississippi River valley, posing challenges and opportunities to many Indian groups far from the center of trade activity on the Atlantic coast.

## Chapter 6 Western Expansion of the Shatter Zone, ca. 1680–1700 

> At the time of the Soto entrada, Chicaza had little intercourse with people on the Mississippi River. Perhaps as early as 1650, however, the Chickasaws entered into the new European trade system; by 1690 they had become primary slave raiders in the region; and by 1702 they controlled a western axis of trade that spanned from the Tombigbee River into Louisiana, unleashing even more turmoil in an area already reeling from eastern shock waves. The Chickasaw experience reflects the rapid expansion of the Indian slave system and Atlantic trade from the eastern seaboard to beyond the Mississippi River and the entanglement of numerous Indian polities in it. It also reflects the abilities of at least one Native group, the Chickasaws, to take advantage of the new trade by becoming militarized Indian slavers. ([2777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2777))
Note: this is all the story of a continents people being integrated into the world developing system of capitalism Edit
There is no good documentary evidence for Europeans in the central and lower Mississippi Valley and the lower South before the 1673 Joliet and Marquette voyage. However, it is possible that the Chickasaws and others in the lower South first became engaged in the commercial slave and fur trade through the coureurs-de-bois(or voyageurs). The coureurs de bois (which translates literally as “woods runners,” but which is commonly translated as “adventurers” or “trappers”) were independent Canadian traders who were scattered throughout the Midwest and mid-South, usually living in Indian villages, where they conducted a trade not only in skins but also in slaves. These men worked through French trading houses in Quebec City and Montreal and frontier outposts such as the Quapaw trading post on the Arkansas River and Kaskaskia in present-day southwestern Illinois.1 The full scope of their numbers and influence in the Midwest and mid-South at this time is not well known. The coureurs de bois certainly could have provided Indian groups with European-manufactured items, if only on a small scale; and, although they are historically known as fur traders, the documents clearly indicate that they also traded in slaves.2 ([2783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2783))

> The above scenarios for Chickasaw and other Indian involvement in the commercial trade in Indian slaves prior to documented direct contact with Europeans is admittedly highly inferential and based only on a few tidbits of evidence. Likewise, the archaeology on Chickasaw involvement is suggestive but not definitive. Recall that sometime around 1650, the Chickasaws ended their sojourn north, settling in the present-day Tupelo area. There, they initially settled in small, dispersed towns across Town, Coonewah, and Chipawa Creeks. However, archaeologists have mapped a contraction of these settlements beginning around 1680 and continuing until 1720. They left Chipawa Creek, save one town, and consolidated their towns on Coonewah and Town Creeks. Clearly the Chickasaws now had much to worry about. In fact, they reported to Thomas Nairne in 1708 that before they had acquired guns, they had suffered terribly from Iroquois raiders, and that the Iroquois had driven them out of their towns.14 Considering Nairne's report and the archaeological data, it appears, then, that sometime around 1680, the Chickasaws began to suffer from Iroquois raiding and pulled their towns closer together. This also marks the Chickasaws’ entry into the Indian slave trade as militarized Indian slavers. Most scholars agree that what attracted the Chickasaws to the present-day Tupelo location was that it was the nexus of several major trails. The Lower Trade Path, the most important east-west thoroughfare from the Atlantic to the Mississippi River, passed through the heart of Creek country before turning northwest to follow the Black Prairie into present-day north Mississippi (see Map 5). Later, once the Upper Trade Path was established through the Upper Creek town of Okfuskee, the Lower Trade Path would join with the Upper Trade Path at the Chickasaw towns. In addition, from their late seventeenth-century location, Chickasaws could also easily connect via a north-south trail with Mobile Bay, where the French would soon settle in 1699. Furthermore, being situated at the headwaters of the Yazoo River gave them access to the Natchez Indians and the Mississippi River.15 There is little question that the Chickasaws understood this place to be a strategic economic and political location, and their move there would suggest that they positioned themselves early on to become pivotal players in the new political economy of the South. ([2845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2845))

> By 1680 a group of ambitious men had arisen in South Carolina to not only dominate the Indian trade but also to challenge the Crown's authority. They have become known as the Goose Creek Men, named after the regional neighborhood near Charlestown in which they lived. The Goose Creek Men formed as a religious and political faction and often challenged both the governing hand of the Lords Proprietors, the Crown's ruling nobility in the new colony. They were interested in the commercial slave trade in Indians and had been seeking to take control of this trade away from the Lords Proprietors almost from its inception. Virginia traders continued buying and selling furs and slaves, but their activities were soon eclipsed by those of the Carolina Goose Creek Men, and South Carolina emerged as the hub of the southern Indian trade. The ambitions of the Goose Creek Men were both unbounded and unscrupulous. They understood all too well that slaves were war captives, and hence they instigated, abetted, and fueled intra-Indian conflicts throughout the South for the next thirty years.22 ([2892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2892))

> The breakup of the Westo monopoly was but one such venture by the Goose Creek Men, who were beginning to flex their economic muscle by the late seventeenth century. In fact, one can attribute many of the early colonial Indian “wars” as stemming from the English efforts to wrest control over the trade from those militaristic slaving societies that had come to monopolize it. The first signs of the first generation of militaristic slaving societies having outlived their usefulness to English trade interests occurred by around 1675, and a series of European and Indian wars ensued. Virginia traders eliminated many of the Occaneechis in 1676 during Bacon's Rebellion, after which the survivors moved farther south (Map 6). The Westos were destroyed in 1682 by a group of Shawnee mercenaries in the pay of the Goose Creek Men. ([2900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2900))

> Much of the population loss of the Saras can be attributed to a massive outbreak of smallpox all along the Atlantic seaboard that occurred in 1696, which historian Paul Kelton calls the Great Southeastern Smallpox Epidemic. As is well known, social disruption and disease go hand in hand, and Kelton argues that to understand the spread, duration, and mortality of introduced diseases into the American South, scholars must begin to link the epidemics to other colonial disruptions—in particular, the early colonial Indian slave trade. Kelton traces the initial outbreak of the 1696 epidemic to Virginia, and he documents its rapid spread throughout the piedmont and into the Carolinas as the disease followed the trade paths between the English and ([2928](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2928))

> Native slave traders. Kelton also documents that the piedmont and Carolina low country Indians suffered tremendously during this epidemic, which lasted about four years.27 The archaeological evidence for life in the piedmont also reflects the ravages of the Great Southeastern Smallpox Epidemic. By the late seventeenth century, piedmont town sizes like those of the Saras were typically small, despite the fact that all of these towns were taking in remnant populations from other towns obliterated by disease and slaving. The whole region was in flux, as seen in these towns having short occupancy at all locations. Towns moved almost every ten years until about 1710, when they began to show more stability.28 ([2935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=2935))

> Other militarized slaving societies emerged along the southern Atlantic coast by 1700. The Yamasees, who had begun to coalesce on the Carolina coast in the mid-seventeenth century, had joined the Guales and Mocamas in their exodus to present-day Florida.

Note: how similar is this to what happened in Africa? Edit
The Indians of present-day central Alabama had been grumbling about Spanish goods, especially the paucity of firearms, for some time. When English traders arrived, with no compunction against selling guns and ammunition, those in Apalachicola, Tallapoosa, Abihika, and Alabama looked favorably on this turn of events and welcomed the newcomers. ([3048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3048))

> Although the Chickasaw trade may have begun slowly with an indirect trade in furs, after the opening of the Carolina trade, pelts became second to Indian slaves in terms of valued trade-exchange items. As Thomas Nairne noted in 1708: “The Chickasaws live in an Excellent hunting country, both for Larg dear [sic], and other game, but the difficulty of carriage makes their trade of less Value, but there is a remedy to be had for this. Formerly when beaver was a comodity [sic] they sold about 1200 skins a year but no imployment [sic] pleases the Chicasaws so well as slave Catching.”58 With a direct line to Carolina and the Goose Creek Men now open, the Chickasaws became a militarized slaving society, and this would prove as disruptive to the region as anything that had come before. ([3116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3116))

> Although clearly diminished from its Mississippian days, Mobila, as some documentary tidbits may indicate, retained something of its stature among Gulf coast peoples into the late seventeenth century. Pénigault testified to a public square and priestly temple of some sort, although he decided the word “temple” was an overstatement. Still, in 1722, Charlevoix wrote in his history of Louisiana that the Mobilians had enjoyed “a sort of primacy in religion, over all the other nations in this part of Florida.” He continued that when the sacred fire of any community in the vicinity went out, representatives made the sojourn to Mobila, where they rekindled it. People for miles around had considered the old mound center at Bottle Creek, which Iberville visited in 1702, as the “place where their gods are, about which all the neighboring nations make such a fuss and to which the Mobilians used to come and offer sacrifices.” Iberville had the audacity to remove five statues—likenesses of a man, a woman, a child, a bear, and an owl—from the premises. Local Indians were amazed that he had not been struck dead on the spot. With imperial nonchalance, Iberville merely remarked that he was planning to take the statues to France, “though they are not particularly interesting.” ([3173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3173))

> The full history of horses in the American South has yet to be written. Still, we know that once horses became available, Southern Indians quickly adopted them and became proficient horsemen and horsewomen. In the early years of the European trade, trade items were packed in and out of Indian towns by burden bearers. However, as the supply of horses increased, so did their utility, until they became indispensable for the conveyance of people and goods. Traders brought European-manufactured goods into Indian towns and exported skins to the colonial towns on packhorse trains, sometimes with as many as 100 packhorses. Slaves, on the other hand, usually made the journey on foot.116 Although Indian people certainly traded in horses, much ([3518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3518))

> with the Choctaw “mother mound” of their oral traditions, Nanih Waiya, were located on the headwaters of the Pearl River, and they either stayed put or moved slightly south. They subsequently became known as the Western Division of Choctaws (see Maps 2 and 3). There is good evidence that the people from lower Tombigbee moved to the southwestern tributaries of the Tombigbee (the Noxubee and the Sucarnoochee Rivers) in the early seventeenth century (see Map 2). Another group from the upper Mobile-Tensaw Delta (some Pensacola culture people) also moved to this vicinity. Both groups joined to become the Eastern Division of Choctaws (see Map 3). The large, Natchez-speaking Plaquemine chiefdom centered at the Pearl Mounds site on the central Pearl River was abandoned before the time of contact and the people relocated to smaller sites. Then in the middle of the seventeenth century, some of these people moved to the upper headwaters of the Leaf River and the western branches of the Pascagoula River; these became the Sixtown Choctaws (see Maps 2 and 3). In the late seventeenth century, another group fled the Mobile Delta as it was being overrun by Alabama Indian slave raiders and moved to the Chickasawhay River to be closer to the Choctaws. They became known as the Chickasawhay Choctaws (see Maps 6 and 7).125 ([3581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3581))

> In 1702, during some peace negotiations, Iberville collected population estimates from Choctaw representatives. At this time, the Choctaws lived in three districts with about 1,090 households, totaling about 3,800 to 4,000 men (or about 12,000 people). Later, cartographer Guillaume Delisle transcribed a list of thirty-eight Choctaw town names that Iberville had collected from the Choctaw representatives. Galloway evaluates this list as a list of Eastern and Western Division towns, meaning either that no Sixtown and Chickasawahay representatives were at the meetings or, more likely, that the two divisions were not yet part of the Choctaws. Still, the list indicates that the Choctaws were functioning as some sort of corporate and political entity by 1702.126 ([3590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3590))

> The Choctaw came to comprise four divisions—the Western, Eastern, Sixtown, and Chickasawhay —and each division contained several towns and villages. Each division, however, retained their own war and peace chiefs, assistants to the chiefs, and council of elders. The divisions sometimes acted in concert, and sometimes they did not. Rather, the divisions integrated their populations through exogamous marriage patterns, thus binding the divisions together through kinship and marriage ties. In order to facilitate this, according to Galloway, two moiety divisions formed: the Imoklasha and the Inholahta. The Imoklasha were the original inhabitants closely associated with Nanih Waiya, and the Inholahta were all the other refugees pouring into east-central Mississippi. According to Choctaw marriage rules, young people from one moiety could only take eligible partners from the other moiety. Such rules tended to integrate the divisions into a single, unified polity. Still, the internal political structure of the divisions tended toward decentralization, since the divisions had a “clearer political focus than the moieties.” The Choctaws successfully negotiated such internal tensions, and they consistently resisted unifying behind a centralized authority despite European efforts and the ambitions of certain Choctaw leaders to promote a single “Great Chief.” The divisions maintained their autonomy throughout the Historic Period.127 ([3596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3596))

> Exactly when and why the sixteenth-century chiefdoms that came to make up the Choctaws began to fall apart and the people to migrate is unknown. Undoubtedly, their demise can be attributed in part to the disruptions in the northern and eastern sectors due to Soto's march through that area; to the early disease episodes that racked the Gulf coast and perhaps the lower Mississippi Valley regions; and, by the mid-to late seventeenth century, to the onslaught of armed slave raiders from central Alabama, northern Mississippi, and regions farther north. In fact, when Iberville first heard of the Choctaws in 1700, they constantly were worried about armed slave raiders and apparently had been for some time. While he was among the Pascagoulas, Iberville learned that the Choctaws were at war with all of the nations to the north and east of them—all of those Indian groups that were “allies of the English that are armed with muskets.”128 ([3607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3607))

> The Carolina traders in the mid-South by the late seventeenth century had attempted to lure the Choctaws into their trading sphere. In addition to establishing trade relations with the Chickasaws, Quapaws, Tunicas, and Natchez, traders had also approached the Choctaws about a possible alliance. The Choctaws, however, looked warily on English promises because, to them, the English only sought to promote the brutal slave trade. Iberville hoped to enlist the Choctaws as potential powerful allies in the imperial contest unfolding in the lower South. Undoubtedly, the Choctaws looked on the French in a similar way. ([3614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3614))

> After Iberville returned from his foray up the Pascagoula River, he left Bienville and Saint-Denis in charge at Fort de la Boulaye and Sauvole at Fort Maurepas. He soon sailed for France, where he petitioned for additional supplies and support for the establishment of a more secure fort and colony. Iberville's third and final voyage to the Gulf coast also signaled an intensification of the European contest over the American South. The shatter zone was already creeping westward, and hundreds of Native lives and dozens of Native polities were being disrupted because of it. Now, European imperial ambitions would become entangled with the commercial Indian slave trade, and the result, as historian Alan Gallay so aptly described, was a “frenzy of slaving” throughout the South.129 ([3618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3618))

Chapter 7 European Imperialism and the Intensification of the Colonial Indian Slave Trade, ca. 1700–1710 

> Iberville set sail from France for the Gulf coast on his third and last voyage in 1701. That same year, a Franco-Spanish pact in Europe had resulted in the War of Spanish Succession, with France and Spain allied against England, Portugal, and the Netherlands. By 1702 the war had moved into the North American theater, where it became known as Queen Anne's War. The Indian slave trade up to this point had been largely a commercial venture, controlled by Indian middlemen and militarized slaving societies. And although frowned upon by colonial authorities, traders often instigated and fomented Indian wars in order to keep the supply of slaves flowing into Carolina. The competition between France, England, and Spain for the American South escalated after news of the voyages of La Salle and Iberville circulated into European courts, and as it did so, the system of warfare and slaving already in place became linked to the imperial aims and wars of European rivals. The frontier imperial strategy was straightforward. None of the imperial powers had enough settlers or military personnel at their beachheads of empire to oversee the vast territories they each claimed. They understood Native allies to be essential tools in defending their claims against other European rivals, patrolling their borders, and taking swift actions against any incursions. Attracting Native allies was done primarily through the lure of the trade, gift giving, and especially the availability of European-manufactured guns and ammunition. The Indian slave trade, of course, had now made guns a necessity and, as we have seen, once the monopolies of the Westos and Occaneechis were broken, other Indian groups were ready participants in the trade. Europeans took advantage of the dependency to intervene in Indian foreign affairs by designating who a group could and could not make war against. The formula was basically this: in order to maintain an open trade, any particular Indian group was compelled to war and raid against only Indians allied with a European rival. For example, English-allied Indians were not to war against English-allied Indians, nor, by law, could they sell English-allied captives on the English slave mart. The same laws were later enacted in French Louisiana. In reality, these laws were only weakly defined around imperial rivalries, and in both cases the laws were halfheartedly enforced.1 When Queen Anne's War erupted, however, the imperial aims of England became strongly tied to that of the commercial slave trade, and the result was an intensification of and political and military purposefulness to slaving. In other words, the conflicts during Queen Anne's War were not simply military tactics; they were also brutal slaving expeditions, as Indian mercenaries and English slave traders stood to gain much economically while at the same time advancing the territorial boundaries of Carolina. With France making inroads into the Mississippi Valley, England had taken notice and sent her scouts deep into the interior in the hopes of winning Native allies through an expanded trade system—hence the journeys of Couture, Welch, and Dodsworth, to name a few. Because of their geographic location on the Upper Trade Path and their willingness to engage with the English, the Chickasaws would play a pivotal role after 1702. ([3624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3624))

> Tonti's first letter, written from a Choctaw village, confirmed what the surrounding Indians had been telling Iberville: the Choctaws were a large and numerous group. Ethnohistorian Patricia Galloway, through a close analysis of the letters and the distances Tonti recorded in them, concludes that as early as 1702, the Choctaws already had been forced to cluster into a relatively small area, and they kept their borders protected by stationing and provisioning small, fortified towns along them. She also understands the Chakchiuma town that Tonti referenced to indicate that the Chakchiumas managed a buffer zone between their main towns on the upper Yazoo River and the Tombigbee River; this buffer zone separated the Choctaws from the Chickasaws. Tonti heard that one of the Choctaw border fortifications was chronically harassed by Chickasaw, Conchaque (Abihka), and Alabama enemies. This was important information for Tonti, and he reasoned that if he could get the Chickasaws to agree to a French alliance, the Abihkas and Alabamas would follow suit. Tonti described the Choctaws as living in dispersed homesteads and farming the bottomlands. ([3684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3684))

> The Choctaws, as an emergent coalescent society, had long abandoned their chiefdom organization.7 The Choctaws undoubtedly had word of Iberville's intentions before Tonti arrived in their midst, and the Choctaw leaders who met Tonti welcomed the French overtures. Choctaw representatives had already sought out the French as potential allies against the Chickasaws and other English-armed slavers, so it should not be surprising that they would be satisfied that Iberville hoped to make a peace between them and the Chickasaws.8 ([3692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3692))

> This brief glimpse at an Indian slave raid gives us some information about how they were conducted. From information that Tonti later gathered, we can see that on a slave raid, a large group would break into smaller groups, attack a village, kill the men, and abduct the women and children. These victims were then bound with the infamous slave cords, which were cords designed to go around the neck and strangle a person if he or she attempted to escape. They were then taken to a holding pen or barracks until enough had been accumulated to send to Carolina.10 ([3703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3703))

> The Englishman denied that he was instigating any wars and explained that the Chickasaws merely brought him war captives that they would have taken in their war exploits anyway. To this, Tonti asked the pointed question as to “why his comrade was leading 400 warriors.”12 The Englishman refrained from answering. Tonti's scornful retort indicates only too clearly that ([3721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3721))

> everyone involved understood the frontier strategy of setting one Indian nation against another in order to obtain slaves. The Englishman's assertion that the Indians made their own wars and that he merely took advantage of such hostilities to purchase captives was, of course, disingenuous. In a later episode, when the Chickasaw mico threatened to expel the Englishman, the trader was back to his old tricks and simply replied that if expelled, he would go to the Abihkas and “invite them to destroy the Chicacha.”13 ([3724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3724))

> When one of them explained to the Chickasaws that he could only speak for his “town,” he likely meant that he could not speak for the other divisions. This is an important point, because it would indicate that, although each of the divisions was part of a whole, each nonetheless maintained autonomy.19 ([3786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3786))

> Finally, Iberville took a count of Choctaw and Chickasaw towns. According to this count, the Choctaws lived in three townships (or districts), with 1,090 households and three to four men per household, totaling about 3,800 to 4,000 men. The Chickasaws lived in 580 households, with three to four males over the age of eighteen per household, totaling at least 2,000 gun men. Iberville also noted that of these, 700 to 800 owned guns.22 ([3821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3821))

> The fate of the Florida Indians, perhaps more than any other Indians in the South, demonstrates the destructive power of a trade in enslaved peoples coupled with imperial ambitions. Within only a few years, the Florida mission system, which incorporated over 25,000 Indians at its height, was destroyed. Terrorized survivors took shelter in a few refugee missions and at St. Augustine, where they remained under assault for several more years. With the mission Indians reduced to such straits, the Carolina-allied Indian slavers penetrated into central Florida, pushing the nonmission Indians all the way to the Florida Keys (see Map 8). Here, in small refugee camps, they awaited rescuing to Cuba by Spanish ships. Between 1706 and 1711, almost all of these Indians were evacuated to Cuba. The whole of Spanish Florida, once one of the most populous regions in the American South, was virtually depopulated and mostly empty. All that remained was a small remnant of Indians and Spanish at St. Augustine. In the late eighteenth century, breakaway Creek groups and runaway African slaves would colonize this region as the Seminoles.35 ([3935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=3935))

> The accepted version of Chickasaw history has been that the Chickasaws were Anglophiles throughout the Historic Period and that the English manipulated them into this position through agreeable trade agreements. But as we have seen, the Chickasaws showed an early inclination to avoid alienating one European power at the request of another. Recall that in 1699 they refused an English trader's request for them to kill Father Davion. In 1703 they accepted the invitation from Iberville to come to Mobile, where they agreed to let Saint-Michel, the young boy, stay among them. In 1707 they requested a French trading house near their towns. Even so, they also welcomed English traders into their towns, participated in the slave trade in order to purchase goods from these traders, and refused to expel them in spite of numerous French requests to do so. Nairne, too, noted that the Chickasaws were attached to the English, but he also saw that there was an internal split along a pro-French and pro-English axis.61 Recent ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence gives us some sense of how this factionalism played out within the Chickasaw towns and among their leadership roles. By the time of Nairne's visit in 1708, the Chickasaws had already pulled in from their dispersed settlement patterns into a more congregated one. Nairne relates that the ravages of disease and warfare had caused the Chickasaws to “break up their Townships and unite them for want of inhabitants.” The towns were now clustered along Town and Coonewah Creeks near present-day Tupelo (Figure 9). In later years, when Frenchmen had more opportunities to visit the Chickasaw towns, they noted dual town clusters and dubbed them Small Prairie towns and Large Prairie towns. We also know now that the Large Prairie towns were war towns, with leadership drawn from the red moiety, and the Small Prairie towns were peace towns, with leadership drawn from the white moiety.62 FIGURE 9 Chickasaw settlements near present-day Tupelo, Mississippi, ca. 1680–1720 (Drawing by Wendy Cegielski.

> Nairne's description is quite detailed, indicating that he probably witnessed the event. Nairne describes a surprise attack in which a small group of men fanned out into a half moon and stealthily approached a village. At a signal from the “Chief Officer,” each warrior “gives the War Whoop, and then catch as catch can. After an exploit is done, good store of prissoners [sic] taken, and Danger a little over, they hang their bages about their prissoners necks and set them all advancing.”75 This slaving was done with all the pomp and ritual of warfare, as detailed by Nairne. Enslaving war captives, then, was nothing new to the Chickasaws, and war captives could be easily linked to commercial slaving. Even so, some critical aspects changed. War captives now consisted of hundreds of women and children, and they were now a commodity sold to European and Indian traders. And as commodities, they were quite valuable. According to Nairne, with a single slave, a Chickasaw man could purchase a gun, ammunition, a horse, a hatchet, and a suit of clothes.76 Nairne may have exaggerated the price in his report; still, slaving was a lucrative enterprise.77 It should be no surprise, then, that Indian slaving expeditions were often quite large, sometimes involving hundreds of men. Recall Tonti's 1702 trip to the Chickasaws and the raiding party of 400 warriors. Recall also that Tonti related that when the raiders returned to their towns, they locked the slaves in holding pens until the English traders were ready to export them.78 Tonti's report, as well as other reports, clearly indicate that women and children comprised the largest number of captives and that there was usually an associated high toll of adult male deaths, both among those being raided and those doing the raiding.79 ([4248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4248))

> Since slaving was part of warfare, and because French and English slave laws stipulated such, the Chickasaws targeted enemy groups in their slaving and, conversely, slave raiding generated military enemies among those being raided. Because of their slaving, the Chickasaws were despised by other Indians throughout the range of their raiding, and they had many enemies. In other words, it was not just the brutality of slave raiding that created inter-Indian hostilities; the slave raids were also acts of war and thus, according to the Southern Indian code of warfare, required retaliation.80 ([4262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4262))

> But where did all of this leave the white, or peace, moiety? Obviously, the leaders of this moiety were responsible for matters of peace, but what does that mean? Again, we can go to Nairne for some hints. Nairne appears to have conducted much of his business with Oboystabee, the War Chief, who assured Nairne that the “military men and their wives”—in other words, the red moiety—were firm friends of the English, and that the only pro-French chiefs among them were “two refuge people who can neither hunt nor take slaves” and who have no influence in these matters.81 In a later passage, Nairne mentions that Chickasaw beliefs prohibited the Peace Chiefs and their villagers (the white moiety) from engaging in war or in slaving, and that they never deliberated in any such matters. One should not take this to mean that the members of the white moiety literally could not engage in hunting, warfare, and slaving, but rather that they had no decision-making authority in matters of war and trade.82 According to Nairne, the Peace Chief of Hallechehoe and the heads of the peace clans were charged with promoting peace and quiet, not shedding blood of any kind, keeping treaties of peace with their friends, and counseling about any affairs “except those concerning Warr.”83 In a later passage, Nairne goes into some detail about another responsibility of the peace moiety—that of appointing a “Fane Mingo,” or Squirrel King. The fanimingo saw to the formal linking of foreign groups through a process of adoption.84 For instance, if the Chickasaws wanted to establish a friendly alliance with an external group, the peace moiety would “adopt” a male of the external group, who would then be responsible for representing Chickasaw interests to the external council; the system worked both ways, and an external group could adopt a Chickasaw fanimingo to represent their interests in Chickasaw councils. The fanimingo, then, was an international diplomatic institution based on Southern Indian principles of kinship.85 And it was a peace-town institution, headed by the white-moiety leadership. ([4268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4268))

> Although we only have the barest outlines of the processes of coalescence after the European invasion, it appears that among the Creeks and others, the disparate groups who coalesced still retained some sense of separation, independence, and identity. The complete absorption of foreign groups in the Chickasaw coalescence suggests that by using the fanimingo as a mechanism of coalescence, the Chickasaws retained their social and political cohesion. This is not to say that the Chickasaws did not modify their social organization in response to the changing political and economic landscape; clearly they did. However, it does appear that the Chickasaw transformation followed a different trajectory than that of other groups in the South. Obviously in this case the moieties were adapting an old institution to new circumstances. ([4306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4306))

> Since slaving and warfare offered new opportunities to access European-made guns, ammunition, and alliances, a strain developed along the lines of the red and white organization. Nairne is very clear that the Peace Chiefs were not supposed to engage in slaving. He also is clear that by 1708 some Peace Chiefs had become disgruntled over their diminished role in this new enterprise.88 Nairne is also careful to point out that the Peace Chief Fattalamee had condoned slave raiding and “turned warrior,” and he had thereby gotten himself in disgrace with the people and lost his office.89 In fact, it looks as though the political power of the peace moiety had begun to erode before Nairne's 1708 visit. Despite the fact that the peace moiety outranked the red moiety, Nairne reported that Chickasaw warriors had little regard for civil authority but much respect for military authority. The erosion of the white moiety's prestige and power, according to Nairne, was directly linked to the fact that they had no say in the traded.90 ([4312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4312))

> The peace moiety, feeling the effects of being excluded from the English slave trade, attempted to broker their own trade with the French, and it was most likely this group with whom Iberville and Bienville had been parlaying. Such maneuvering by the red and white moieties became more and more pronounced over time, resulting in an internal Chickasaw factionalism that fell along red and white, or Large Prairie-Small Prairie, lines.91 The Small Prairie towns became largely French partisans, and the Large Prairie towns became largely English partisans. Now, instead of conducting internal and external affairs along neat moiety lines, the leadership of each moiety sought to widen their jurisdictions. The white moiety became involved in something that had theretofore been in the arena of war; they began making unilateral decisions regarding the trade and, hence, warfare. And the red moiety eventually intruded into white duties such as the fanimingo, as when the Large Prairie towns allowed the Natchez refugees to join their towns. This was done over the strenuous objections of the Francophile Small Prairie towns, the white towns responsible for such foreign affairs.92 The European trade system thus worked to transform an indigenous institution by promoting internal factionalism and, in the case of the Chickasaws, by redefining the basis of the dual moiety organization from one of complementarity to one of competition. Despite the strain that they put on Chickasaw society, internal factionalism, competition, and fluid roles, as scholars increasingly demonstrate, were good tools for brokering with competing European powers. The red/white moiety system served as the internal mechanism by which the Chickasaws could successfully link to the capitalist economy. It was easily linked because of the form this new economy initially took—that of a slave trade, which squared well with Chickasaw rules and roles of war and peace. Certainly, warfare was an essential part of precontact Mississippian life. But with European contact, the incentives for warfare and violence changed. Archaeologists are not certain of all the motives for Mississippi Period warfare; once Europeans came on the scene, however, one can see that war efforts became largely motivated by commercial interests and tied to international trade and European imperial ambitions in ways that would have been inconceivable prehistorically.

## Chapter 8 The Emergence of the Colonial South, ca. 1710–1715 

> By 1708, the year of Thomas Nairne's journey into the interior, the Chickasaws and other Southern Indians were feeling the strains of their participation in the slave trade. Certainly, the trade was lucrative and enticing and opened new opportunities to young and ambitious men and women. The trade, though, was generated from a new global economy largely predicated on the sale of armaments, the use of debt and credit, and an overwhelming tendency to deplete resources. Then, between 1702 and 1713, the years of Queen Anne's War, the Indian trade system became linked to the imperial aims of England in the scramble for colonies. By 1715 virtually all Indian societies in the American South were ensnared in an economic matrix of debt, slaving, militarization, and warfare. At this point, Southern Indians could not extricate themselves from the trade system even if they tried—and they did try in the Yamasee War of 1715. ([4337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4337))

> With slaving engulfing the entire Native South, it is worth pausing to scrutinize the demographic profile of the slave trade. We have only a few accounts from the South about commercial slaving expeditions, but they give us a grasp of how they worked. As we have seen, commercial slaving was conducted as a part of warfare; therefore, slave raids resembled warfare and were conducted by male warriors. In some cases, small groups of about a dozen men would conceal themselves in the woods around vulnerable towns and snatch people as opportunity allowed. Another tactic was a full-scale, surprise raid on a town by a group of warriors. In the attack, the warriors of the town would marshal a defense. If the raiders managed to break the town's defense, they seized the town, taking captives and killing any who could not escape. The records indicate that those captured were mostly women and children. The elderly and the very young were killed in the melee. There were also high death tolls of adult men on both sides. Some figures from Chickasaw population estimates in the early eighteenth century illustrate this. In 1708 Nairne counted eight Chickasaw towns, with a total population of 700 warriors, or about 2,100 to 2,400 people. In 1702 Bienville had reported there were about 2,000 men or 6,000 to 8,000 people. One observer noted about the Chickasaws that they had destroyed many nations but also at a considerable cost to themselves and their numbers had dwindled.9 After a raid, captives not designated for adoption or exchanges by the Indian slavers were kept in holding pens before being taken to the European port towns. The infrastructure in the South at this time consisted mostly of overland trails, so all captives had to be capable of walking very long distances to port towns. This could account for the killing of the very young and the very old; neither had the stamina to make the journey. ([4420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4420))

> Historian Alan Gallay recently calculated that between 1685 and 1715, the Carolinians alone enslaved 24,000 to 51,000 Indians, although he thinks these numbers are low.11 ([4436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4436))

> In fact, in recent years, scholars have argued that depopulation from disease and slaving were primary factors in the Yamasee War. As with many capitalist ventures, the tendency is to overexploit the very resource on which the venture depends. In this case, the “resource” was Indian slaves, and within about eighty years of the inception of the commercial Indian slave trade, southern slavers were simply running out of people to capture and sell. The Native South population collapse was at its nadir by 1715, the result of rampant slaving and widespread disease. Historian Paul Kelton has argued that the root cause for the Yamasee War was demographic. By 1715 over 80 percent of the indigenous peoples of the South had either been enslaved or killed by diseases or warfare. The survivors had moved closer to European colonies or were grouping into formidable coalescent societies such as Apalachicola, Abihka, Tallapoosa, Okfuskee, Alabama, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw, against which slavers were finding it increasingly difficult to raid (see Map 8). Simply put, the supply of Indian slaves was nearly gone and the remaining available supply was difficult to obtain. In addition, slave raiders were suffering their own heavy losses that were incurred in slave raiding, especially that of their young men.15 ([4452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4452))

> Two abuses point out the demographic realities of a collapsing trade in Indian slaves: the confiscation and sale of adopted kin by Carolina traders and the pitting of English-allied slave partners against one another. Although Indian slaving during the colonial years was done primarily for commercial reasons, since it overlay an indigenous system, it played out as a system combining both commercial and indigenous features. As discussed earlier, the indigenous system of slavery was tied to war, in that slaves were taken from a pool of war captives. Captors had complete control over their captives’ lives at the time of capture, and unless the captives managed to escape or commit suicide, their fates were in the hands of their captors. However, slavery was but one fate of the war captives. Their captors could also exchange them with foreigners as diplomatic gestures, sell them to others, marry them, or adopt them into their own kin groups. Given the extreme losses of life in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, more and more captors opted to adopt or marry their captives or sell them to other Indians, who then adopted or married them. ([4474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4474))

> The entire American South was now caught in the grim web of commercial Indian slaving, and although the trade had been lucrative for a time, by 1715 it had turned into a house of horrors. No one was safe, and no one was guaranteed that he or she would not suddenly be sold into slavery. Those suffering most from the enterprise—which was by now the whole of the Southern Indians—took up arms in a gallant effort to stop the abuses, the tensions, the fears, and, ultimately, the Indian slave trade itself. The first sign that Indian groups were on the point of rebellion came with the outbreak of the Tuscarora War. After the Occaneechi monopoly was broken in the late seventeenth century, the Tuscaroras stepped in to become the predominant piedmont middlemen in Virginia's Indian trade in skins and slaves. When Carolina was settled, the slave trade widened to the Appalachians and beyond, and the Tuscaroras found themselves increasingly hemmed in by Cherokee and Esaw raiders, thus reducing their resource base for both skins and slaves (see Map 8). European immigration into North Carolina exacerbated the situation, as they settled on coastal Indian lands close to the Tuscarora towns. They also brought more disease to a region already devastated by epidemics. Allied with Virginia rather than Carolina and beset by Carolina-allied slavers, the Tuscaroras began to develop serious malice toward North Carolinians. This malice turned to hostilities in 1711, when a group of ([4518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4518))

> Tuscaroras ambushed a Carolina survey team on the Neuse River—a group that included frontiersman John Lawson, who had recorded much about Indian life that he had observed on his forays into the piedmont. A large Tuscarora war party then took to the war path against the North Carolina settlements. Carolina took swift action and collected a militia, first under the leadership of John Barnwell and then James Moore Jr., both of whom subsequently enlisted over 1,000 Indian warriors. Not coincidentally, many of their Indian troops were from the Cherokees, the Esaws, and the small Siouan piedmont groups who had been ([4528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4528))

> Between 1540 and 1720, the years of the European invasion and the Indian slave trade, the entire geopolitical landscape in the American South was transformed. To call this time and place the Mississippian shatter zone captures something of the nature of this transformation and the historical forces at play that generated it. We are only just beginning to understand precisely what happened when a Mississippian chiefdom fell; many of them most likely broke apart, although the lines of breakage are unclear. Splinter groups must have migrated short and long distances and joined other splinter groups as they reorganized themselves into altogether new social types. The Gulf coast and Carolina low country Indians, for example, represent new social types. In the case of the low country Indians, these groups did not coalesce but remained small, independent groups living in the Carolina low country until the Yamasee War.36 Like the low country Indians, the Gulf coast Indians did not coalesce but remained small and independent groups. Unlike the low country Indians, who eventually joined larger coalescent groups, the Gulf coast groups stayed in and around New Orleans throughout the Historic Period, and some are still there today. There, they joined with Africans, Europeans, and other Native refugees to develop a unique economy and Creole culture.37 ([4663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4663))

> Archaeologist John Worth identifies a social type born out of the geopolitical instability of the contact era that he calls “aggregation,” wherein immigrant communities attached themselves to functioning chiefdoms, presumably in a ([4673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4673))

> subordinate position. This process was especially prevalent in Spanish Florida, and many refugees from slaving fled to Florida, where they joined the Apalachee and Timucuan chiefdoms. Aggregation may also have been taking place at Natchez, Kadohadocho, Hasinai, and perhaps even Powhatan, all of which were functioning chiefdoms in the seventeenth century and are known to have taken in refugees.38 Yet all of the chiefdoms that served as nodes of aggregation could not withstand the sustained instability in the Mississippian shatter zone. Powhatan was destroyed by 1650 after a series of wars with the Virginians. The chiefdoms of Spanish Florida were destroyed by 1710. The Caddo chiefdoms began to break up around the same time, with the survivors reconfiguring themselves into so-called confederacies.39 The Natchez chiefdom broke apart after the 1729 revolt, with splinter groups joining the Chickasaws, Creeks, Caddos, and others. ([4675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4675))

> The mechanisms of coalescence, likewise, are only now coming to light. Marriage, adoption, linguistic affiliations, and former chiefdom alliances were all used to glue disparate groups together. In some cases, the mechanism may have determined whether or not a group was absorbed or retained some sort of separate identity. The Natchez and Alabamas, for instance, both used marriage as a way to weave newcomers into extant social orders. In the case of the Natchez, however, the newly married entered on the lower rung of the Natchez social order, whereas among the Alabamas, newcomers who married in entered as full-fledged members of the group. On the other hand, in delineating the origins of the Creek Confederacy, we have seen that migration and coalescence into plural societies were common mechanisms for dealing with chiefdom instability. These mechanisms were most likely put to a new use in the Mississippian shatter zone to merge the polities in present-day central Alabama into the Creek Confederacy and to take in refugee groups. In the case of the Creeks, all of the various groups retained their political and social identities. The Chickasaws, too, put an old social institution to a new use in the Mississippian shatter zone, but with different results. The Chickasaw absorbed people through the fanimingo institution; the Chakchiumas and perhaps others were completely absorbed in the Chickasaw order, and, as far as we can tell, they became Chickasaws. These are just some of the processes identified so far. As these examples show, although monumental and transformative, contact with Europeans did not leave Native lives absolutely destroyed. The Mississippian world may have collapsed, but in the restructuring that followed, people rebuilt their communities and constructed new social and ([4692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4692))

> political organizations using some social institutions that resembled those of their former chiefdoms. The new societies maintained institutions and practices such as town councils, blood revenge, reciprocity, clan organization, corn agriculture, hunting and gathering, and a matrilineal kin system, all of which had their roots in the Mississippi Period and perhaps even in prior times. These institutions and practices proved to be highly adaptable and could be integrated into the new global economy. For example, the southern Native domestic economy and division of labor were flexible enough to form linkages to the capitalist system. The broad structural patterns of southern Native households show much continuity from the Mississippi Period until the early nineteenth century. ([4705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4705))

> Other institutions, however, were totally transformed. The hierarchical political institutions of the old chiefdoms, for instance, simply did not work in the new geopolitical landscape and capitalist economy. The European trade system worked to transform indigenous leadership institutions by promoting internal factionalism and redefining the basis of power and authority from one of succession through kinship and religious sanction to one of economic prowess and international diplomatic skills. After all, English traders did not have to persuade an anti-English, hereditary mico to come over to their side. They could and did simply ally with another person in that society. Given the disunity of the coalescent societies, usually several men could claim influence over any particular faction. The English chose to deal with whoever seemed most inclined to listen to their overtures, and given the new opportunities for self gain, this could be any number of people. An Indian man who had a modicum of influence over a particular faction could broker good trade deals and rise in prestige and authority. An Indian man's position became tied to his access to European trade goods and his political, business, and diplomatic savvy. The overall effect was at once a leveling of political power and a check on the rise of any one person to political prominence. With the chiefdom political order revamped, we also see the disappearance of those emblems of power and authority associated with the hierarchy. People quit building mounds; craftspeople quit producing elaborate religious and political paraphernalia; the priestly cult used to buttress the elite was transformed into a cadre of prophets administering to the common person; and chiefs were no longer considered to be divine but were merely mortal men. In time, all was replaced by town councils of warriors and elders wherein every man was given equal opportunity to participate in decision making.

> number of Africans made their way to Indian country, where they joined the coalescent societies and built homes and families there. A small number of European traders, too, cast their lot in Indian country, where they married Indian women and moved back and forth between their European and Indian circles. An even smaller number of European women also opted to marry, raise families, and live among the Indians rather than among their countrymen. The children from these mixed marriages, through their contacts and comfort in both European and Indian societies, would eventually take the reins of leadership in the coalescent societies.

> Epilogue After the Yamasee War, the Chickasaws, as well as the other Southern Indians, segued from trading in Indian slaves to trading in skins, mostly those of the white-tailed deer. Throughout the slaving era, skins and furs had been a part of the trade system, but they took second place to the more highly valued Indian slaves. After the Yamasee War, when slaving was proving to be more difficult, Indian men and women throughout the South increased the amount of skins they were trading, until the deerskin trade came to be one of the most profitable eras in southern history for the English colonies. The deerskin-trade era had its own disruptions and violence, but relative to the earlier slaving era, general stability settled over much of the region, and especially over the large coalescent societies in the interior. Maps from this time period would look quite different from the maps presented in this book. The Chickasaws, already strategically located for the trade, took full advantage of their English connections and geography to flourish during the deerskin-trade era. Archaeological evidence points to a marked increase in trade goods flowing into Chickasaw country, and recent investigations hint at large prosperity for them by the mid-eighteenth century. The deerskin trade, however, began to decline after the American Revolution. The Chickasaws and other Southern Indians once again cast about for new commodities for the market, and they began to experiment in ranching and commercial farming. Of the two, ranching at first proved especially promising. During this time, many people moved out of their nucleated towns into widely dispersed farms, fanning across the landscape for good access to grasses and other browse for their free-range livestock. At the same time, the United States began its program of development among Native peoples, attempting to remake them into American yeoman farmers. The government promoted cattle and hog ranching, and the Chickasaws once again proved to be in a good location for the enterprise. The Black Prairie was perfect for free-range ranching, and the Chickasaws adapted well to the changing economic situation. As cotton began to rule the southern economy, however, southern politicians, land speculators, and planters cast their eye over Chickasaw country and, indeed, over all of Indian country in the South. The result was the forced removal of the majority of the Southern Indians to Oklahoma. ([4749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=4749))

> The historical trauma of Indian Removal was deep for the Southern Indians, and life in their new lands was difficult for most, as it required much reconfiguring of their economic system, social system, political system, and even what it meant to be Indian. Throughout the nineteenth century, the southern coalescent societies began the long process of nation building in the hopes of standing equal with the United States. However, the Civil War and the Dawes Act of 1887 undermined these efforts and once again left the Indian nations as colonial subjects of the United States. In the postcolonial, late twentieth century, Southern Indian nations experienced a resurgence, and they again embarked on the difficult task of nation building. Indian nations today, after centuries of the shattering effects of colonialism, still have a difficult task ahead of them, as they battle problems such as unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, poverty, and diabetes among their people. What these modern efforts will produce has yet to be seen, but today hundreds of Indian scholars, social workers, teachers, medical professionals, politicians, artists, writers, students, journalists, filmmakers, laborers, elderly people, and others are making their voices heard and laboring hard to improve Indian life across America. To say that an early twenty-first-century renaissance among American Indians is in the making would not be an overstatement, and the Chickasaw Nation, along with many others, are making it happen.

> 2 Placing the Atlantic world as a subset of a larger global economy follows Coclanis, “Atlantic World or Atlantic/World?” However, Coclanis prefers a neo-Marxist approach rather than a Wallerstenian world-systems approach. See also Gallay, “Charles Town.” ([5351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=5351))

> 3 Gallay, “Beachheads into Empires.” Alan Gallay, especially, has begun developing a framework for thinking about these commercial outposts. He calls them “hot spots” — “locales that had extraordinary impact economically, culturally, and diplomatically on large regions which they also linked to the greater world”; see Gallay, “Charles Town.” 4 For a discussion of the global experiences of these European immigrants, see Games, “Beyond the Atlantic.” Carson, in Making an Atlantic World, 61–64, makes the point that these early European colonists understood the value of adopting and using indigenous practices in their colonial projects. For a detailed treatment of a southern American colony as a trade factory, see Kupperman, The Jamestown Project. ([5353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=5353))

Galloway here also notes that, although these documentary fragments are informative, one should not make too much of them. In Choctaw Genesis, 196, Galloway also reminds us that these so-called chiefs may not have been chiefs in French or Choctaw terms. ([6214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004JN0UH2&location=6214))

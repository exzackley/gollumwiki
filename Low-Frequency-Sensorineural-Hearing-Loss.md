### Hearing loss and hearing aid related: 

- Hearing loss: HL!
- [Speech-reception threshold (SRT)](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/speech+reception+threshold): The minimum intensity in decibels at which a patient can understand 50% of spoken words; used in tests of speech audiometry. Also called speech recognition threshold.

- Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) test 
- Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE): the sounds that come out of the cochlea in a OAE test.
- Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs): sounds that come out of the cochlea in the most common kind of OAE test, which use tones instead of clicks. 
- [Ototoxic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ototoxicity): toxic to the ear.
- Occlude/Occluding: stop, close up, or obstruct (an opening, orifice, or passage). e.g. hearing aids for low frequency hearing loss are usually occluding.

- Roll off: the smooth fall of response to zero at either end of the frequency range of a piece of audio equipment.

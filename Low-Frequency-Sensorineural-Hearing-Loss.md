### Some terms: 

- [Speech-reception threshold (SRT)](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/speech+reception+threshold): The minimum intensity in decibels at which a patient can understand 50% of spoken words; used in tests of speech audiometry. Also called speech recognition threshold. 
- Monaural: pertaining to one ear
- Hearing in noise test (HINT): here's an article [about it](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2445&context=etd). 
- Decibles: [1](http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/noise_education/web/ENG_EPD_HTML/m1/intro_5.html), [2]()
- threshold equalizing noise (TEN)
- Threshold Equalizing Noise test (TEN(HL))
- high-frequency emphasis (HFE) 
- Quick Speech In Noise (QSIN)
- [Inner Hair Cells (IHCs)](http://www.cochlea.eu/en/hair-cells/inner-hair-cells-ihcs-stucture)
### Some fundamental acoustics concepts:

- [Low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter), [High-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter)
- [Band-pass filer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter)
- [Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain)

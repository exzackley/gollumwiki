Take a deep breath. This book is going to be a place where we let go of a lot of things we think we know are true, even though we haven’t thought about them very much. I’m not asking you to let go of them forever, just let go of them when you’re in these pages with me. 

Everyone is welcome to these pages, but I’m writing them for a pretty specific audience. This is for all the crazy middle class and wealthy liberal/left/progressive Americans out there who for some reason are committing their lives to some version of “making the world a better place for everyone.” I'm coming from the same place. When I call you crazy, I’m calling us both crazy. 

We’re crazy in a good way — or at least in a way that the world really needs. We’re crazy because we’re committed to this goal even when we know that it will be a lot of hard work, will never make us rich and may have absolutely no chance of success.  

At the same time, we’re dangerous. In a bad way. We have tremendous power to disrupt and disable people’s movements. Its almost like we are precision political smart bombs crafted specially for that purpose. And yet, no people’s movement has ever taken power without at least a few of us hanging around.

Most of us have no idea, if we’re honest with ourselves, why we’re so personally hooked on this naive mission to save the world. We just are. And most of us are totally confused about how this is supposed go. Are we supposed to work in electoral politics? Or for non-profits? Or go join the labor movement? Or the Social Capitalist movement? Or should we just sit around and wait for the next Occupy-style revolution to break out? And hey, was that a revolution, or just a protest? 

It’s no accident that most of us are confused. These days, the best among us are the most confused. All of the simple choices have been made obsolete by the radical transformations of the past several decades, and by the crumbling away or ossification of big chunks of what used to be called the left. If you’re not confused, then you’re not using your head, and you’re probably plodding down a dead end path.

This is an incredibly exciting moment in history for crazy and confused people like us. All the old paradigms of political thought, that have been standing in our way for decades -- or centuries -- are crumbling. And it is an incredibly dangerous and high-stakes moment in history for people like us. All sorts of bad, old, almost-extinct ideas are waiting to rush in and fill the void.

This is the time to read history with crazy, confused, fresh eyes — to examine the world we live in as it is, not as we grew up thinking it was, and not as lefty, progressive or liberal dogmatists later instructed us it was. This is the time to ask a whole lot of “dumb” questions of the past and present -- to let the facts knock groundless assumptions out of our heads one by one, to become brand new people.

This is a time for people like us to find in history the forgotten moments when practical dreamers stumbled on to the keys that unlocked totally unexpected opportunities for humanity in their time — and then to go frantically looking for those keys in our own time. 

Now, as my four year old daughter invites me about every 15 minutes with boundless energy and job, I would like to invite you: “Come on, let’s go!”

Or... maybe you’re not feeling all that confused. You know your “theory of change” and you're sticking to it. Then why are you still reading? You should have dropped out two pages ago. I suspect, therefore, that there’s a seed of doubt somewhere in there with the well-ordered world view that you had handed to you in college, or wherever you got it. 

In that case, there is still hope of us connecting and having a good conversation through this book. 

So tell me who you are? 

Are you a protester? Do you believe that we’ll fix the world by massing thousands in the streets and carrying out acts of civil disobedience on the evening news?

Are you a petition deliverer? Is the plan to show the politicians and corporations in an orderly way that millions are watching them and lobby for change?

Are you “living the alternative into being”? Do you believe the way to change to world is to create a new one right next to the old, by starting co-ops and buying local?

Are you actually a member of one of the socialist or communist parties that are still choking along? 

Or are you just sticking with the Democratic party, working for candidates, trying to keep the party’s head above water until that demographic shift kicks in that they promise will give you a permanent majority? 

If you're in any of those groups, the good news is that there are sections ahead addressed specifically to you. If you’ve come this far, you must be looking for something — keep reading. 

Maybe you’ll find it.
